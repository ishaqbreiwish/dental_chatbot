Purpose
The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry ( AAPD ) 
recognizes that caries-risk assessment and management proto-  
cols, also called care pathways, can assist clinicians with  
decisions regarding treatment based upon a child’s age, caries  
risk, and patient compliance and are essential elements of con-  
temporary clinical care for infants, children, and adolescents.  
These recommendations are intended to educate healthcare 
providers and other interested parties on the assessment of  
caries risk in contemporary pediatric dentistry and aid in  
clinical decision making regarding evidence- and risk-based 
diagnostic, fluoride, dietary, and restorative protocols.
Methods
This document was developed by the Council on Clinical 
Affairs, adopted in 20021, and last revised in 20192. To update 
this document, an electronic search was conducted of publi-  
cations from 2012 to 2021 that included systematic reviews/  
meta-analyses or reports from expert panels, clinical guidelines, 
and other relevant reviews using the terms: caries risk assess-  
ment AND diet, sealants, fluoride, radiology, nonrestorative 
treatment, active surveillance, caries prevention. Five hundred 
ninety-two articles met these criteria. Papers for review were 
chosen from this list and from references within selected  
articles. When data did not appear sufficient or were incon-  
clusive, recommendations were based upon expert and/or 
consensus opinion by experienced researchers and clinicians.Background
Caries-risk assessment
Risk assessment procedures used in medical practice generally 
have sufficient data to accurately quantitate a person’s disease 
susceptibility and allow for preventive measures. However, in 
dentistry, sufficiently-validated multivariate screening tools to  
determine which children are at higher risk for dental caries 
are limited.3,4 T wo caries risk assessment tools, namely the 
Cariogram5 and CAMBRA tools6, have been validated in clinical  
trials and clinical outcomes studies. Several other published 
caries-risk assessment tools utilize similar components but 
have not been clinically validated.5,7 Nevertheless, caries-risk  
assessment:
 1.  fosters the treatment of the disease process instead of  
  treating the outcome of the disease. 
 2.  allows an understanding of the disease factors for a  
  specific patient and aids in individualizing preventive  
  discussions. 
 3.  individualizes, selects, and determines frequency of  
  preventive and restorative treatment for a patient. 
 4.  anticipates caries progression or stabilization.Caries-Risk Assessment and Management for

Abstract
This best practice reviews caries-risk assessment and patient care pathways for pediatric patients. Presented caries-related topics include  
caries-risk assessment, active surveillance, caries prevention, sealants, fluoride, diet, radiology, and nonrestorative treatment. Caries-risk  
assessment forms are organized by age: 0-5 years and ≥6 years old, incorporating three factor categories (social/behavioral/medical, clin-  
ical, and protective factors) and disease indicators appropriate for the patient age. Each factor category lists specific conditions to be graded  
“Yes” if applicable, with the answers tallied to render a caries-risk assessment score of high, moderate, or low. The care management  
pathway presents clinical care options beyond surgical or restorative choices and promotes individualized treatment regimens dependent  
on patient age, compliance with preventive strategies, and other appropriate strategies. Caries management forms also are organized by  
age: 0-5 years and ≥6 years old, addressing risk categories of high, moderate, and low, based on treatment categories of diagnostics, pre-  
ventive interventions (fluoride, diet counseling, sealants), and restorative care. Caries-risk assessment and clinical management pathways  
allow for customized periodicity, diagnostic, preventive, and restorative care for infants, children, adolescents, and individuals with special needs.   
This document was developed through a collaborative effort of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry Councils on Clinical Affairs and  
Scientific Affairs to offer updated information and recommendations regarding assessment of caries-risk and risk-based management protocols.

Caries-risk assessment is part of a comprehensive treatment 
plan approach based on age of the child, starting with the age 
one visit. Caries-risk assessment models currently involve a 
combination of factors including diet, fluoride exposure, a 
susceptible host, and microflora that interplay with a variety of 
social, cultural, and behavioral factors.8 Caries-risk assessment  
is the determination of the likelihood of the increased inci-  
dence of caries (i.e., new cavitated or incipient lesions) during 
a certain time period9,10 or the likelihood that there will be a 
change in the size or activity of lesions already present. With 
the ability to detect caries in its earliest stages (i.e., noncavitated 
or white spot lesions), health care providers can help prevent 
cavitation.11 
Caries risk factors are variables that are thought to cause  
the disease directly (e.g., microflora) or have been shown useful in predicting it (e.g., life-time poverty, low health literacy) 
and include those variables that may be considered protective  
factors. The most-used caries-risk factors include low salivary 
flow, visible plaque on teeth, high frequency sugar consump -
tion, presence of appliance in the mouth, health challenges, 
sociodemographic factors, access to care, and cariogenic 
microflora.11 The presence of caries lesions, either noncavitated 
or cavitated, also has been shown in numerous studies to be 
a strong indicator of caries risk. Clinical observation of caries 
lesions, or restorations recently placed because of such lesions, 
are best thought of as disease indicators rather than risk 
factors since these lesions do not cause the disease directly or 
indirectly but, very importantly, indicate the presence of the 
factors that cause the disease. Protective factors in caries risk 
include a child’s receiving optimally-fluoridated water, having

topical fluoride from a health professional, and having regular

Some limitations with the risk factors include the  
following:
•  Past caries experience is not particularly useful in young 
children, and activity of lesions may be more important 
than number of lesions. 
•  Low salivary flow is difficult to measure and may not  
be relevant in young children.13 
•  Frequent sugar consumption is hard to quantitate. 
•  Sociodemographic factors are just a proxy for various 
exposures/behaviors which may affect caries risk. 
•  Predictive ability of various risk factors across the life span and how risk changes with age have not been  
determined.14 
•  Genome-level risk factors may account for substantial 
variations in caries risk.
Risk assessment tools can aid in the identification of  
specific behaviors or risk factors for each individual and allow 
dentists and other health care professionals to become more  
actively involved in identifying and referring high-risk children. 
Tables 1 and 2 incorporate available evidence into practical  
tools to assist dental practitioners, physicians, and other non-  
dental health care providers in assessing levels of risk for  
caries development in infants, children, and adolescents. As  
new evidence emerges, these tools can be refined to provide

greater predictably of caries in children prior to disease initia -
tion. Furthermore, the evolution of caries-risk assessment tools 
and care pathways can assist in providing evidence for and 
justifying periodicity of services, modification of third-party 
involvement in the delivery of dental services, and quality of 
care with outcomes assessment to address limited resources  
and workforce issues.
Care pathways for caries management
Care pathways are documents designed to assist in clinical 
decision making; they provide criteria regarding diagnosis and 
treatment and lead to recommended courses of action.15 The 
pathways are based on evidence from current peer-reviewed 
literature and the considered judgment of expert panels, as  
well as clinical experience of practitioners. Care pathways for  
caries management in children aged 0-2 and 3-5 years old  
were first introduced in 2011.16 Care pathways are updated 
frequently as new technologies and evidence develop. 
Historically, the management of dental caries was based 
on the notion that it was a progressive disease that eventually  
 destroyed the tooth unless there was surgical/restorative inter-  
vention. Decisions for intervention often were learned from  
unstandardized dental school instruction and then refined by  
clinicians over years of practice. It is now known that surgical  
intervention of dental caries alone does not stop the disease  
process. Additionally, many lesions do not progress, and tooth  
restorations have a finite longevity. Therefore, modern manage-  
ment of dental caries should be more conservative and includes  
early detection of noncavitated lesions, identification of an  
individual’s risk for caries progression, understanding of the  
disease process for that individual, and active surveillance to  
apply preventive measures and monitor carefully for signs of  
arrest or progression. 
Care pathways for children further refine the decisions 
concerning individualized treatment and treatment thresholds  
based on a specific patient’s risk levels, age, and compliance  
with preventive strategies (Tables 3 and 4). Such clinical path-  
ways yield greater probability of success, fewer complications,  
and more efficient use of resources than less standardized  
treatment.15

Content of the present caries management protocol is  
based on results of systematic reviews and expert panel  
recommendations that provide better understanding of and  
recommendations for diagnostic, preventive, and restorative  
treatments. Recommendations for the use of fluoridated  
toothpaste are based on four systematic reviews17-20, dietary 
fluoride supplements are based on the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention’s fluoride guidelines21, professionally-  
applied and prescription strength home-use topical fluoride are  
based on two systematic reviews19,22, the use of silver diamine  
fluoride to arrest caries lesions also is based on two systematic  
reviews23,24. Radiographic diagnostic recommendations are 
based on the uniform guidelines from national organizations.25 
Recommendations for pit-and-fissure sealants are based on 
two systematic reviews26,27, with only the American Dental 
Association/AAPD review addressing sealants for primary  
teeth. Dietary interventions are based on a systematic review of  
strategies to reduce sugar-sweetened beverages.28 Caries risk is  
assessed at both the individual level and tooth level. T reatment  of caries with interim therapeutic restorations is based on  
the AAPD policy and recommended best practices.29,30 Active  
surveillance (prevention therapies and close monitoring) of  
enamel lesions is based on the concept that treatment of  
disease may only be necessary if there is disease progression,31 
and that caries can arrest without treatment.32 
Other approaches to the assessment and treatment of dental  
caries will emerge with time and, with evidence of effectiveness,  
may be included in future guidelines on caries-risk assessment  
and care pathways.
 
Recommendations 
	1.   Dental caries-risk assessment, based on a child’s age,  
social/behavioral/medical factors, protective factors, and  
clinical findings, should be a routine component of new  
and periodic examinations by oral health and medical  
providers.

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-5-periodontal-diseases 2/28This guidance is issued jointly by the Department of Health and Social Care,
the Welsh Government, the Department of Health Northern Ireland, Public
Health England, NHS England and NHS Improvement, and with the support
of the British Association for the Study of Community Dentistry.
Delivering Better Oral Health has been developed with the support of the 4
UK Chief Dental Ofﬁcers.
Whilst this guidance seeks to ensure a consistent UK wide approach to
prevention of oral diseases, some differences in operational delivery and
organisational responsibilities may apply in Wales, Northern Ireland and
England. In Scotland the guidance will be used to inform oral health
improvement policy.
Introduction
Whilst several conditions may affect the tooth-supporting tissues referred to
as the periodontium or gums, the following sections focus on the most
common forms of periodontal diseases, called ‘gingivitis’ (inﬂammation of
the gums that can be reversed) and ‘periodontitis’ (inﬂammation that results
in loss of periodontal attachment)[footnote 1]. The early stages of disease may
be symptom-free, but the impact on peoples’ lives of later stage disease are
more serious[footnote 1], particularly as the disease is irreversible.
Gingivitis and periodontitis are separate conditions, although both are
initiated by plaque in susceptible people. Gingivitis is a risk factor for
periodontitis, although not all people or sites with gingivitis go on to develop
periodontitis. The prevention and management of periodontitis is described
here in terms of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention as shown in
Chapter 1 (Table 1.1) (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-
better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-1-
introduction#table1). Because both conditions are initiated by plaque, the
primary prevention of periodontitis will also prevent gingivitis.
As the use of dental implants to replace missing teeth has increased, 2 new
conditions, peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis, have become
apparent[footnote 2]. These conditions may be analogous to gingivitis and
periodontitis. Additional advice for the prevention of these conditions is
provided at the end of this chapter.
Deﬁnitions9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 5: Periodontal diseases - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-5-periodontal-diseases 3/28The 2017 World Workshop classiﬁcation of periodontal and peri-implant
conditions[footnote 3][footnote 4], can be summarised as follows.
Periodontal health
Periodontal health is the absence of clinically detectable inﬂammation
(<10% of sites bleeding on probing), on an intact periodontium, or a
reduced periodontium where attachment loss has resulted from anything
other than periodontitis.
Gingivitis
Gingivitis is an inﬂammatory condition resulting from interactions between
the dental plaque and the host’s immune response, which remains
contained within the gingiva and does not extend to the periodontal
attachment (cementum, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone). Such
inﬂammation is reversible by reducing levels of dental plaque at and below
the gingival margin.
Periodontitis
Periodontitis is a microbially-associated, host-mediated inﬂammation that
results in loss of periodontal attachment. A patient is said to have
periodontitis if:
interdental clinical attachment loss (CAL) is detectable at ≥2 non-adjacent
teeth
or
buccal or oral CAL ≥3 mm with pocketing ≥3 mm is detectable at ≥2 teeth,
where the lost clinical attachment cannot be ascribed to another cause
Periodontitis causes progressive destruction of the tooth‐supporting tissues.
Signs of the disease include clinical attachment loss, manifested as
interdental recession and/or periodontal pocketing and alveolar bone
loss[footnote 4]. This chronic and inﬂammatory disease is caused by a
complex interplay of risk factors, with dental plaque being the most
important[footnote 4].9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 5: Periodontal diseases - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-5-periodontal-diseases 4/28Epidemiology
Some level of irreversible periodontitis affects almost half of UK
adults[footnote 5], although this might underestimate true disease levels.
Similar levels of periodontal diseases are present globally, with the latest
evidence suggesting that around 10% of the world’s population (8.2 to
11.4% age standardised) has evidence of severe disease[footnote 6]. The
peak in prevalence occurs between 60 and 64 years of age[footnote 6], and
there are marked inequalities by socio-economic status. About half of all
adults have some evidence of moderate disease and thus, it is one of the
most common chronic inﬂammatory diseases globally.
Age need not be a barrier to good periodontal health[footnote 7][footnote 8]
[footnote 9][footnote 10][footnote 11], particularly when people can undertake the
necessary self-care and are able to visit the dental team.
Risk or susceptibility and protective
factors
In addition to plaque build-up, tobacco (smoking or chewing) and alcohol
use, several general health conditions are risk factors for periodontal
diseases. Conversely, there are risks to general health resulting from having
active periodontal diseases.
Some systemic disorders, such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases,
share similar genetic and/or environmental inﬂuences with periodontal
diseases, thus affected people may have signs of either or both
conditions[footnote 12][footnote 13].
International consensus of joint dental and medical experts, based upon
evidence from systematic reviews, recommends the importance of
periodontal therapy in reducing the risks of diabetes and its
complications[footnote 14].
There is ongoing debate about the role of periodontitis in cardiovascular
diseases[footnote 15][footnote 16], but at present no ﬁrm conclusions can be
drawn. Also, there is insufﬁcient information to determine the true
relationship between rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis[footnote 17].
Likewise, the evidence linking lifestyle factors such as stress[footnote 18]
[footnote 19], poor diet[footnote 20][footnote 21], being overweight[footnote 22], or
cannabis use[footnote 23], is insufﬁcient to suggest a clear association with
periodontal diseases.9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 5: Periodontal diseases - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-5-periodontal-diseases 5/28Plaque
Dental plaque is a highly organised and specialised ﬁlm of bacteria in an
organic matrix that forms on the teeth. The intercellular matrix consists of
various micro‐organisms and their by‐products. The bacteria mutually
support each other, using chemical messengers, in a complex and highly
evolved community, that can protect them from an individual’s immune
system and chemical agents.
Normally, small amounts of bacteria cause only minimal inﬂammation, but a
disruption in the balance (dysbiosis) between the plaque and person’s
immune system can lead to the initiation of gingivitis and progression to
periodontitis[footnote 1].
Tobacco
Tobacco smoking and use of smokeless tobacco products have a profound
effect on the risk of developing periodontitis[footnote 24][footnote 25]. They also
impair the treatment response. Cessation of tobacco use can prevent
further deterioration of periodontal health (Chapter 2: Table 2
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-2-summary-guidance-tables-for-
dental-teams#table2); Chapter 11
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-11-smoking-and-tobacco-use)).
Vaping
Evidence suggests that although not risk free, using an e-cigarette (vaping),
is far less harmful to health than smoking. Findings about the impact of
vaping on periodontal health are inconsistent but suggest people who vape
are at greater risk for periodontal diseases compared to non-
smokers[footnote 26]. However, it is helpful to recognise that most people who
vape are former smokers and will have experienced the effect of smoking
on their periodontal health. It will take time to build a clear picture of their
longer-term periodontal health through longitudinal research. E-cigarettes
may, however, have a lower risk of periodontitis than tobacco and therefore
provide a helpful transition to cessation for smokers (Chapter 11
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-11-smoking-and-tobacco-use)).9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 5: Periodontal diseases - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-5-periodontal-diseases 6/28Alcohol
There is emerging low-certainty evidence that alcohol consumption is
associated with periodontitis[footnote 27][footnote 28]. Possible mechanisms of
action may be related to alcohol’s negative impact on bone density and
saliva secretion. Advice on managing alcohol risk reduction is presented in
Chapter 12: Alcohol (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-
better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-12-alcohol).
Diabetes
Glycaemia in those without a diagnosis of diabetes, and hyperglycaemia in
those with diabetes are both risk factors for poor periodontal health[footnote
29] and also impair the response to its treatment. While well-controlled
diabetes is not a risk factor, many people oscillate between different levels
of control. Therefore, it is best to assume an increased risk of periodontal
diseases for anyone who has diabetes[footnote 30].
Medications
Several medications may affect periodontal health, which underlines the
importance of a comprehensive and up-to-date medical history.
Medications may cause:
dry mouth – antidepressants[footnote 31], and other drugs can cause dry
mouth
gingival enlargement – most commonly seen with calcium channel
blockers for cardiovascular disease[footnote 32], although other drugs can
also have this effect
Therefore, it is good practice to check the possible side-effects of patient
medications in a formulary.
Primary prevention of periodontitis9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 5: Periodontal diseases - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-5-periodontal-diseases 7/28Risk factor control
The primary prevention of periodontitis and gingivitis involves control of any
risk factors. An overview of risk factors and their management is presented
in Chapter 2: Table 2 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-
better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-2-summary-
guidance-tables-for-dental-teams#table2). As gingivitis is a predictor of
developing periodontitis[footnote 33], and thereafter tooth loss[footnote 34], its
prevention also helps in the primary prevention of periodontitis. Importantly,
risk factor control is also the mainstay of the management of established
gingivitis and periodontitis (that is, secondary and tertiary prevention[footnote
35][footnote 36].
In view of the chronic nature of the disease and risk of the irreversible bone-
loss, self-care is vitally important. For everybody, the primary preventive
goals are to develop good plaque removal skills and to avoid tobacco.
Effective and regular toothbrushing from infancy and interdental plaque
removal from 18 years of age (beforehand if evident disease) are therefore
the main skills required from an early age (Chapter 8
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-8-oral-hygiene)). All dental team
members play a major role in assessing, coaching, and supporting patients
with self-care. Whilst professional intervention plays an important role for
people with advanced disease, no clinical beneﬁts of ‘routine scale and
polish’ have been demonstrated for adults with good periodontal
health[footnote 37].
Plaque control
The central role of plaque in the pathogenesis of periodontitis means that its
control is essential in the maintenance of periodontal health.
Comprehensive advice on oral hygiene instruction (OHI) is outlined in
Chapter 8 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-
health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-8-oral-hygiene) on oral
hygiene.
The importance of behaviour change approaches in support of plaque
control is increasingly recognised[footnote 38][footnote 39] within periodontal
care. Contemporary approaches encourage patients to understand how oral
hygiene might beneﬁt them, to develop conﬁdence in their oral hygiene
abilities, to set targets for change that they feel able to achieve and to
challenge perceived barriers to performance. Some of these methods
address common barriers to an effective oral hygiene routine that may have
been missed during traditional instruction.9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 5: Periodontal diseases - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-5-periodontal-diseases 8/28Useful resources include the Oral Hygiene TIPPS video
(https://www.sdcep.org.uk/published-guidance/periodontal-management/oral-
hygiene-tipps-video/)[footnote 40], which was devised by the Scottish Dental
Clinical Effectiveness Programme. Oral Hygiene TIPPS (Talk, Instruct,
Practice, Plan, Support) is a behaviour change strategy for dental teams
helping them to increase patients’ conﬁdence in their ability to perform
effective plaque removal and help them plan how and when they will look
after their teeth and gums. Behaviour change is covered in detail in Chapter
3 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-3-behaviour-change), which has
case studies
(https://khub.net/documents/135939561/516396401/DBOH+Behaviour+change+Cas
e+studies.pdf/0a2d5b97-b27c-83dd-f172-5164998e14aa) (PDF, 116KB) relating
to managing patient self-care.
Whilst brief behaviour change interventions have the potential to improve
plaque control over traditional oral hygiene instruction alone[footnote 41]
[footnote 42], the evidence to date is not robust[footnote 41]. There is low to
moderate certainty evidence that motivational methods, involving plaque
disclosure and repeated OHI reduce plaque[footnote 39]; and, very low to low
certainty evidence that motivational methods reduce gingivitis. Amongst
teenagers receiving orthodontic care, there is moderate certainty evidence
that reminders reduce plaque and gingivitis in the short term, and very low
certainty evidence that they do so over a 3-month period[footnote 43][footnote
44].
The potential for m-Health (mobile phone messages) to support oral
hygiene in mothers, children and orthodontic patients is being tested, but to
date there is insufﬁcient evidence to make ﬁrm recommendations[footnote 45]
[footnote 46].
Removal of plaque retention factors
In sites where calculus and overhanging restorations with ledges prevent
plaque removal (BPE Code 2), the retentive factor can be removed. This
may not be necessary where there are no signs of gingivitis but may be
required if there is evidence of disease.
Smoking cessation
Cessation of tobacco use can prevent further deterioration of periodontal
health. Information about checking patients’ smoking status and for helping
people to quit is provided in the chapter on tobacco and smoking (Chapter9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 5: Periodontal diseases - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-5-periodontal-diseases 9/2811 (https://www..gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-11-smoking-and-tobacco-use)).
Smoking should be managed by Asking, Advising and Acting in line with the
strong evidence on brief interventions outlined in the oral cancer text to be
found in Chapter 2: Table 4
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-2-summary-guidance-tables-for-
dental-teams#table4).
Alcohol risk reduction
To keep health risks from alcohol to a low level it is safer not to drink more
than 14 units a week on a regular basis (see Chapter 12: Alcohol
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-12-alcohol))[footnote 47].
Diabetes control
The following actions are advised[footnote 13][footnote 30].
In addition to usual good practice for periodontal diseases prevention,
people with diabetes should be informed of the implications for their
periodontal health.
Discuss how diabetes control affects periodontal health and ask about their
level of glycaemic control, also known as HbA1c. Levels consistently below
7.0% (8.6 mmol/L) indicate good control. The target HbA1c value for most
people with diabetes is 6.5% or below in line with IFCC (International
Federation of Clinical Chemistry) or 48mmol/mol (or below) DCCT (diabetes
control and complications trial). Units are increasingly calculated in
mmmol/mol
(https://www.diabetes.co.uk/downloads/ﬁles/HbA1c%20units%20DCCT%20to%20IF
CC.pdf) (PDF, 190KB). It is worth noting that people may be set different
threshold units by their team; thus dental teams should explore this with
each patient[footnote 48].
Encourage people to maintain good diabetes control (including diet,
medication, exercise and so on) and to follow up with the diabetes physician
regularly.

and health, particularly HbA1c levels. Download template letter9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 5: Periodontal diseases - GOV.UK

Inform the physician about the patient’s periodontitis status, which may help
the physician to tailor diabetes care and advice appropriately and support
the person with diabetes in maintaining more effective control.
Periodontal treatment may improve diabetes control among affected people
and it is associated with reduced complications of diabetes[footnote 14].
Medication management
Members of the dental team will be used to enquiring about their patients’
medications as part of a medical history. Speciﬁc assessments and actions
are relevant to periodontal health.
Ask
Ask people on medication if they experience dry mouth or swollen gums.
Assess
Assess the oral cavity for any impact of medication, for example, dry mouth,
mucosal changes, caries, extensive plaque deposits or candida infection or
gum swelling.

Secondary prevention of periodontitis9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 5: Periodontal diseases - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-5-periodontal-diseases 11/28Early detection and management pathways: basic
periodontal examination
Early detection and treatment of periodontitis increases the likelihood of
tooth retention[footnote 49]. One screening tool that is well known and quick to
use is the Basic Periodontal Examination (BPE)[footnote 50]. The BPE uses
the WHO BPE probe and is suitable for routine assessment of all dentate
adults (Table 5.1).
Table 5.1. BPE codes
CodeObservation
0 Healthy gingival condition with no bleeding on probing
1 Bleeding on probing
2 Plaque retention factor present (for example calculus, overhanging
restoration)
3 Black band extending 3.5mm to 5.5mm is partially obscured
(indicates pocket 4mm to 5.5mm)
4 Black band extending 3.5mm to 5.5mm is completely obscured
(indicates pocket of 6mm or greater)
* Furcation involvement
Detailed advice on the use of the BPE is provided in the Greater
Manchester Local Dental Network’s (2019) Healthy Gums Do Matter[footnote
51] and the British Society for Periodontology and Implant Dentistry (BSP)
BPE guidelines[footnote 50]. It is important to note that the BPE does not
provide a diagnosis, nor does it assess the response to treatment, as
pockets do not always reduce, even in successful treatment.
The BPE has also been adapted for early detection of periodontal diseases
in children, as periodontitis can manifest in childhood and adolescence, but
is difﬁcult to detect without probing[footnote 52]. Therefore, all children from
the age of 7 years onwards should be examined with a modiﬁed BPE. The
BSP summary guidance indicates how to do this in 2 age bands: 7 to 11
years and 12 to 17 years as presented in Table 5.2.

Managing periodontitis
As for any disease, the management of periodontitis will depend on its
extent, severity and rate of progression. An overview of risk factors and their
management is presented in Chapter 2: Table 2
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-2-summary-guidance-tables-for-
dental-teams#table2).
Patients with BPE scores of 0 to 2 are deemed not to have periodontitis and
therefore only require primary prevention. As periodontitis and gingivitis
have common risk factors, prevention of one will prevent the other. As set
out above, primary prevention involves plaque control, the removal of
plaque retention factors and management of other risk factors that either
increase the risk of developing periodontitis or complicate its successful
care.
Patients with BPE scores of 3 or 4 may have periodontitis. Preventive care
may therefore involve secondary (detecting the early stages of periodontitis
and intervening before full symptoms develop) or tertiary prevention
(softening the impact of periodontitis by helping people manage its long-
term consequences with Supportive Periodontal Care (SPC)).9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 5: Periodontal diseases - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-5-periodontal-diseases 13/28Secondary prevention will involve more detailed periodontal charting to
identify affected sites, as patients with these BPE codes will have pockets of
≥4mm or ≥6mm respectively[footnote 50]. Plaque scores may identify areas
with speciﬁc oral hygiene problems to be managed[footnote 53].
The European Federation of Periodontology has developed S3 level
evidence-based clinical practice treatment guidelines for periodontitis, which
have been adapted and adopted by the BSP for implementation in the
UK[footnote 53]. Once the patient has an established diagnosis of
periodontitis, it may be managed by a stepwise approach to therapy as
outlined in the guidance[footnote 53].
Sextants coded 3 should receive initial therapy including self-care advice
(oral hygiene instruction and risk factor control). After the patient has had
time to respond to this, a 6-point pocket chart should be recorded in the
affected sextant to monitor progress and advise the patient accordingly.
If there is a code 4 in any sextant then record a 6-point pocket chart to
identify affected sites throughout the entire dentition. Tertiary prevention in
patients who have undergone initial therapy for periodontitis, and who are
now in the maintenance phase of care will require full probing depths
throughout the entire dentition recorded at least annually. It is important to
support patients with clear advice as part of supportive periodontal care
Chapter 2: Table 2 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-
oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-2-summary-guidance-
tables-for-dental-teams#table2).
The 2017 World Workshop on Classiﬁcation of Periodontitis[footnote 3] is
useful in classifying the stage and speed of breakdown of periodontitis as
part of the detailed assessment required in patients with the disease.
New classiﬁcation of periodontitis
The new classiﬁcation of periodontitis[footnote 3][footnote 54] describes the
historical degree of periodontal breakdown (stage) and the speed of the
breakdown (grade)[footnote 54]. It was adapted for implementation in the UK
healthcare system by the BSP[footnote 55]. An overview is presented in Table
5.3.
The BSP adaptation classiﬁes the disease into 4 stages based on severity
(I, II, III or IV) and 3 grades based on disease susceptibility (A, B or C). The
stage of periodontitis cannot reduce, because the bone loss is largely
irreversible, but may increase[footnote 54].

Notes:
If a patient has interproximal attachment loss but BPE codes of only 0, 1
and 2, (for example, a previously treated, stable periodontitis patient), and
radiographs are not available or justiﬁable, staging and grading should be
performed on the basis of measuring attachment loss in mm from the CEJ
and estimation of concomitant bone loss.
If a patient is known to have lost teeth due to bone loss likely to have been
within the apical third of the root, stage IV may be assigned.9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 5: Periodontal diseases - GOV.UK

Supportive periodontal care ( SPC) after treatment for
periodontitis
Periodontitis is a chronic disease that will recur and worsen without good
plaque control[footnote 8][footnote 56]. This is the basis for providing SPC, which
involves a long-term commitment from the patient and an intensive level of
support, monitoring and care from the dental team. Trials have compared
different types of SPC, with inconclusive results, but to date there have
been no randomised controlled trials comparing SPC to no SPC[footnote 57].
The evidence for the clinical efﬁcacy of subgingival air polishing compared
with ultrasonic debridement for systemically healthy patients in periodontal
maintenance is still limited and remains inconclusive[footnote 58]. Some
patients preferred ultrasonic compared to hand instrumentation because it
took less time.
Components of SPC include:[footnote 59][footnote 60]

commitment required and need for patient adherence

debridement or professional mechanical plaque removal (PMPR):
removal of supra and subgingival plaque and calculus (PMPR)
root surface debridement of pockets 5mm and deeper with bleeding on
probing
Patient adherence to plaque control is central to periodontal care as
removal of supra and subgingival plaque and calculus is of limited value in
the absence of high standards of plaque control[footnote 37].
In patients with type 2 diabetes, there is moderate certainty evidence that
SPC improves metabolic control and reduces systemic inﬂammation[footnote9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 5: Periodontal diseases - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-5-periodontal-diseases 16/2861]. These ﬁndings have been supported by several systematic reviews.
However, the certainty of the evidence and the amount of reduction in
HbA1c varies[footnote 62][footnote 63][footnote 64]; there is insufﬁcient evidence to
determine if this effect is maintained beyond 4 months.
Findings for any beneﬁt of periodontal therapy on hypertension remain
inconclusive[footnote 65].

There is a range of mouthrinses, mouthwashes and sprays available to the
public, in addition to mechanical plaque control with dentifrices, for longer or
short-term use.
The body of available evidence suggests that of the products evaluated,
there is high certainty evidence for the use of chlorhexidine mouthrinse to
reduce dental plaque and gingivitis[footnote 66][footnote 67]. Both 0.1 and 0.2%
chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwashes are effective for preventing plaque
formation and reducing gingival inﬂammation during the early healing period
after periodontal and implant surgery[footnote 66]. Plaque scores (very low
certainty evidence) and gingivitis scores (moderate certainty evidence) are
reduced to a similar degree, whether using chlorhexidine mouthrinse
containing sodium ﬂuoride or chlorhexidine alone[footnote 67]. It is important
to note that chlorhexidine gluconate may be incompatible with some
ingredients in toothpaste and therefore it is important to rinse the mouth
thoroughly with water between using toothpaste and chlorhexidine-
containing products. Longer term use of chlorhexidine mouthrinse has
adverse effects including extrinsic tooth staining; taste disturbance or
alteration; effects on the oral mucosa including soreness, irritation, mild
desquamation, and mucosal ulceration or erosions; general burning
sensation or a burning tongue. This product is, therefore, advised for short-
term use.
There is very little reliable evidence available to draw conclusions about
effects of chlorhexidine antiseptic sprays on plaque and gingivitis[footnote 68].
There is, however, low to moderate certainty evidence that adjunctive
antiseptics in mouthrinses, including essential oils and cetylpyridinium
chloride (CPC) provide statistically signiﬁcant reductions in gingival,
bleeding and plaque indices when compared to mechanical plaque control
alone[footnote 69]. Similar results were shown for other reviews involving
herbal[footnote 70], aloe vera[footnote 71][footnote 72], green tea[footnote 73] and
polyphenol[footnote 74] rinses.
Peri-implant health
Dental implants may be used to replace missing teeth. However, the soft
tissues and bone around dental implants[footnote 75], are at the same risk of
inﬂammation and progressive disease as those around natural teeth[footnote
38]. Among patients with implants the prevalence of peri-implant mucositis
and peri-implantitis are approximately 43% and 22% respectively[footnote 76].
Superﬁcial inﬂammation (peri-implant mucositis) and true breakdown (peri-
implantitis) around dental implants are common[footnote 75], and evidenced9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 5: Periodontal diseases - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-5-periodontal-diseases 18/28by bleeding on gentle probing, erythema, swelling and/or suppuration[footnote
2].
Poor oral hygiene, a history of periodontitis, smoking, diabetes, and lack of
supportive care appear to be risk factors for peri-implant disease[footnote 2]
[footnote 77][footnote 78]. Whilst previous systematic reviews have shown limited
or conﬂicting evidence regarding the role of smoking as a risk factor for peri-
implantitis[footnote 78][footnote 79], a more recent systematic review provides
low certainty evidence from 8 cross-sectional surveys of a signiﬁcant
association (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.25‐2.3)[footnote 80]. There is also low certainty
evidence that the placement of implants in smokers is associated with
implant failure, postoperative infection, and marginal bone loss[footnote 81].
Deﬁnitions
Peri-implant health
The main clinical characteristics of peri-implant health is an absence of
clinical signs of inﬂammation, absence of bleeding and/or suppuration on
gentle probing, no increase in probing depth compared to previous
examinations and absence of bone loss beyond crestal bone level changes
resulting from initial bone remodelling[footnote 4][footnote 82].
Peri-implant mucositis
The main clinical characteristic of peri‐implant mucositis is bleeding on
gentle probing. Erythema, swelling and/or suppuration may also be
present[footnote 82]. The diagnosis is based on the presence of bleeding
and/or suppuration on gentle probing with or without increased probing
depth compared to previous examinations and absence of bone loss
beyond crestal bone level changes resulting from initial bone
remodelling[footnote 4][footnote 82].
Peri-implantitis
Peri‐implantitis is a plaque‐associated disease of the tissues around dental
implants, characterised by inﬂammation of the mucosa and progressive loss
of supporting bone[footnote 2][footnote 82]. Diagnosis of peri-implantitis includes
presence of bleeding and/or suppuration on gentle probing, increased
probing depth compared to previous examinations and the presence of
bone loss beyond crestal bone level changes resulting from initial bone
remodelling.
In the absence of data from a previous examination the diagnosis of peri‐
implantitis is based on a ‘combination of presence of bleeding and/or9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 5: Periodontal diseases - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-5-periodontal-diseases 19/28suppuration on gentle probing, probing depths of ≥6 mm and bone levels ≥3
mm apical of most coronal portion of intraosseous part of implant’[footnote 2].
Prevention of peri-implantitis
The principles of prevention around implants are the same as for teeth and
focus on effective control of plaque and management of other risk
factors[footnote 83][footnote 84]. However, plaque control around implants is
more challenging due to the circumferential nature of peri-implantitis
lesions, as well as plaque retention around cemented restorations and the
design of super-structures that hinder access to the implant surface for
brushing. An overview of risk factors and their management is presented in
Chapter 2: Table 2 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-
oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-2-summary-guidance-
tables-for-dental-teams#table2).
Monitoring of implants includes regular checking of soft tissue health
visually and by probing. Radiographs are required to monitor bone stability
over time[footnote 82]. Unresponsive pockets with bleeding, pus and/or
progressive bone loss (as indicated by presence of bone loss beyond
crestal bone level changes resulting from initial bone remodelling) indicate
peri-implantitis[footnote 82].
At each visit:
monitor plaque and marginal inﬂammation
monitor probing depths and compare them to baseline (following
placement of prosthesis) and previous visits, bleeding, and presence of
pus
take appropriate radiographs as indicated and compare with the time of
prosthesis placement and subsequent ﬁlms
debride all supra and submucosal plaque and calculus
consider early referral to specialist for unresponsive deepened pockets
with bleeding, or pus and progressive bone loss
decide on recall interval based on peri-implant and periodontal status
There is low certainty evidence that SPC can potentially maintain peri‐
implant health measured in terms of implant success rates, and prevent
peri‐implant mucositis, and/or peri‐implantitis[footnote 85][footnote 86].

Deﬁnitions
Tooth wear is the cumulative loss of mineralised tooth substance due to
chemical and/or mechanical factors[footnote 1].
Its components are:
dental erosion (chemical loss due to exposure to either intrinsic or
extrinsic non-bacterial acids)
dental attrition (physical loss due to tooth-to-tooth contact)
dental abrasion (physical loss caused by objects other than teeth, such
as a toothbrush, hard object, or the tongue)
The term dental abfraction (a notched out area of the tooth at the gingival
edge, associated with vigorous brushing) has been used to describe micro-
stress fractures of the tooth due to occlusal loading, although there is a lack
of clinical evidence that this is a separate cause of tooth wear, and so the
term is not recommended.
Tooth wear is normally multi-factorial[footnote 2][footnote 3]; it involves a
combination of erosion, attrition and abrasion, leading to a change in shape
or form of the tooth. It is now commonly accepted that dental erosion is a
more complex process than merely chemical wear[footnote 1].
By deﬁnition, dental erosion is the dissolution of tooth mineral where plaque
is not involved in its aetiology[footnote 4]. Remineralisation is possible only in
enamel, provided there is no corresponding mechanical loss; once tissue is
lost, tooth wear becomes irreversible[footnote 5]. As the condition progresses,
which is not inevitable, visible changes to the tooth shape occur[footnote 6].
On the occlusal surfaces of molars, discrete lesions exposing dentine9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 7: Tooth wear - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-7-tooth-wear 3/19appear, which can merge to create a wider and deeper lesion, thus causing
the crown height to reduce. On anterior teeth, attritional wear combined with
erosion on the incisal surface is common. On the buccal/facial surface
ﬂattening of the contour can, without prevention, lead to loss of crown height
if it merges with incisal wear.
Tooth wear terminology has developed in recent years. The use of the term
‘tooth surface loss’ in the clinical situation is now discouraged[footnote
1].Terms such as non-age-related tooth wear and accelerated tooth wear
are used to reﬂect a more nuanced holistic approach to this condition.
Erosive tooth wear (that is, tooth wear with erosion as its primary
aetiological factor) is used in recognition that severe tooth wear rarely
happens without a contributing acidic aetiology. Since a range of terms is
commonly used, and this can be confusing, this document uses the generic
term tooth wear, which is internationally recognised[footnote 1].
Identifying and monitoring tooth wear in
clinical practice
Tooth wear is a natural part of ageing and so the extent and seriousness of
any wear must be judged against a patient’s age[footnote 1]. It can occur in
children, and in primary as well as permanent teeth. Severe tooth wear may
lead to poor aesthestics and a reduced lifespan of the teeth involved.
Sensitivity is not necessarily an indication of progression. Sensitivity occurs
when there is stimuli of patent dentinal tubules, and this can occur with
minimal wear, particularly in the cervical region. Sensitivity is a common
complaint (60% report concerns) among those attending specialist care for
tooth wear[footnote 7].
Secondary prevention is therefore key to management of tooth wear. This
means identifying ‘non-age-related tooth wear’ as early as possible and
focusing on identifying and preventing the risk factors that can lead to
progress in affected individuals. In doing so, dental team members may
identify people with eating disorders and medical conditions for which they
require additional support for their overall health and wellbeing.
The Basic Erosive W ear Examination
(BEWE ) index
Several indices have been developed to measure and monitor tooth
wear[footnote 1][footnote 8][footnote 9][footnote 10][footnote 11]. For example, the9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 7: Tooth wear - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-7-tooth-wear 4/19Tooth Wear Index by Smith and Knight[footnote 10], which proposes a
distinction of pathological levels of wear based on a patient’s age, is widely
used – although limitations in the index have been recognised, and
adaptations subsequently developed[footnote 9]. There is also the Tooth Wear
Evaluation System (TWS), which is now in its second version[footnote 8].
The BEWE is a simple screening tool based on the principles of the Basic
Periodontal Examination (BPE). The BEWE records the most severely
affected surface for each sextant, which means it entails a similar clinical
procedure to the BPE’s sextant approach. The BEWE is a 4 point scale from
0 to 3, with 1 representing early change, 2 less than 50% and 3 more than
50% of the surface involved. All teeth are examined and the surface with the
highest score in a sextant is recorded. The cumulative score highlights the
extent of the condition and can assist in the management of the condition
for the practitioner[footnote 11]. This tool has been validated for use[footnote 12],
including in primary dental care[footnote 13]. It provides evidence to inform
discussions with affected patients and its use is recommended during all
patients’ routine examinations[footnote 14]. A BEWE score of 3 (wear affecting
over 50% of a surface) present in every sextant justiﬁes further investigation
and multiple level 3 scores indicate severe wear.
BEWE  Score 1
First tooth wear signs. Initial loss of surface texture (brightness loss, opaque
surface or ‘frosted glass’ appearance) but with a discrete area on the buccal
(facial) surface and minimal loss of the incisal edge.
BEWE  Score 2
Distinct defect. Hard tissue loss less than 50% of the surface area. Dentine
is often involved. Loss of clinical crown height less than 50% from the
buccal aspect.
BEWE  Score 3
Hard tissue loss signs, with more than 50% of the surface area. Dentine is
often involved but is not a prerequisite for a BEWE score of three. For
restored teeth, the tooth wear can only be scored provided that the size of
the restoration does not exceed 50%.9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 7: Tooth wear - GOV.UK

Tooth wear in the UK
The 2009 national (England, Wales and Northern Ireland) survey of dentate
adults found that 2% had severe tooth wear (exposing the pulp or
secondary dentine), 15% had moderate wear (exposing a large area of
dentine on any surface) and 77% had some wear present[footnote 15][footnote
16]. This varied with age, since damage is cumulative: 44% of dentate adults
aged 75 to 84 years had some moderate wear compared with 4% of 16 to
24 year olds. Moderate wear was more common in men (19%) than women
(11%)[footnote 15][footnote 16].
Prevalence of tooth wear amongst adults had increased slightly since the
1998 survey, when 11% of adults had moderate wear. The increase was
greatest in younger adults: in 2008, 4% of 16 to 24 year olds had moderate
tooth wear, compared with only 1% in 1998[footnote 17].
Tooth wear is present in primary as well as permanent teeth. The 2013
national survey of children (England, Wales and Northern Ireland) found that
one-third (33%) of 5 year olds had evidence of tooth wear on one or more of
the buccal surfaces of their primary upper incisors, although only 4% of 5
year olds had wear which involved dentine or pulp[footnote 18]. The 2013 child
survey also looked for tooth wear on permanent upper incisors and ﬁrst
permanent molars of 12 and 15 year olds. Although some evidence of tooth
wear was common: 38% of 12 year olds and 44% of 15 year olds had some
tooth wear on the lingual surfaces of incisors, only 2% and 4% respectively
had tooth wear involving the dentine or pulp[footnote 18]. Amongst children,
tooth wear involving dentine or pulp in these index teeth was similar to the
prevalence reported in the 2003 survey data for these age groups. Tooth
wear is more common on lingual surfaces of upper central incisors than
buccal surfaces, and more common on buccal than lingual surfaces of
premolars.
A study in Ireland measured tooth wear at 5 years of age, and again when
the children were 12 years old[footnote 19]. There was a signiﬁcant
association between the presence of tooth wear with dentine exposed in the
primary dentition, and tooth wear on the occlusal surfaces of the ﬁrst
permanent molars at 12 years old. Screening for tooth wear in younger
children is therefore important, to enable early preventive advice and
support to be given[footnote 19].9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 7: Tooth wear - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-7-tooth-wear 6/19General population advice for patients
Although the prevalence of tooth wear may be increasing and we are more
aware of the condition, most people do not have accelerated tooth wear.
General oral health advice for patients without visible signs of accelerated
tooth wear is shown in Chapter 2: Table 4
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-2-summary-guidance-tables-for-
dental-teams#table4) and is the same as in the dental caries and periodontal
disease tables. It includes the adoption of good dietary practice enjoying a
healthy diet (Chapter 10 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-
better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-10-healthier-
eating)), and cleaning teeth effectively (Chapter 8
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-8-oral-hygiene)), with a standard
ﬂuoride toothpaste (Chapter 9
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-9-ﬂuoride)).
Research at population level increasingly highlights the role of acidic
beverages, particularly soft drinks[footnote 20][footnote 21][footnote 22] and fruit
juices[footnote 22]. Whilst concerns have also been raised about fruit[^23,
national surveys within the UK over the past 9 years show that the majority
of children and adults do not consume enough fruit and vegetables for a
healthy diet[footnote 24]. The vast majority of the population, therefore, are not
at risk of accelerated tooth wear because of excessive fruit consumption
and should not be given advice to reduce the volume or frequency of fruit
consumption which is beneﬁcial for general health. Snacking on fruit should
not be discouraged amongst the general population.
Risk factors
Tooth wear is multifactorial. Much of the available evidence to date relates
to epidemiological and laboratory research, together with professional
advice. The former involving cross-sectional studies of associations at
population level and from higher risk groups attending specialist services,
suggest that increased tooth wear is associated with extrinsic acid (from
food, drink and medications), as well as intrinsic acid (from the stomach due
to gastro-oesophageal reﬂux, rumination, vomiting and eating disorders), or
a mixture of factors.
Unlike demineralisation in dental caries, there is no clear-cut critical pH for
dental erosion to occur, because other inﬂuences such as a drink’s mineral
content may moderate its erosive action. For example, the calcium content
in calcium enriched drinks may reduce the erosive effect of those9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 7: Tooth wear - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-7-tooth-wear 7/19drinks[footnote 25]. Furthermore, saliva plays an important role in diluting and
buffering acids and facilitating their clearance through swallowing[footnote 26].
Increased erosive potential of extrinsic acids occurs when there is:
lower pH value
lower salivary ﬂow
lower buffering capacity (takes longer for saliva to neutralise the acid)
higher titratable acidity (more available H+ ions in solution)
lower calcium and phosphate content in saliva (inﬂuences degree of
saturation)
lower ﬂuoride content
higher temperature (that is, if drinks are warmed, erosive potential is
increased)[footnote 26][footnote 27][footnote 28][footnote 29]
The ‘erosive potential’ of a wide range of food, drinks and medicines is
measured by laboratory ﬁndings which suggest that drinks, juices, fruits,
and some medications and alcoholic drinks cause a signiﬁcant decrease in
pH of enamel samples[footnote 27][footnote 29].
It is generally accepted that acidic drinks are the most common unhealthy
type of drinks in respect to acid erosion[footnote 27][footnote 29][footnote 30], as
outlined in Table 7.1.
Carbonated water, with fruit ﬂavouring or lemon has been shown to have
high erosive potential[footnote 28], as have ‘fruit juices’ or fruit teas[footnote 30]
[footnote 31][footnote 32]. Multiple products are marketed as fruit juices. It is
therefore increasingly important to distinguish between fruit juice and fruit
drinks. Fruit juice is a drink that is prepared by mashing the pulp of the fruit,
while a fruit drink is a sugary solution that contains the colour and ﬂavour of
the fruit but not the real fruit juice. Some fruit drinks do contain a little of the
fruit juice, but the rest is essentially ﬂavour and colour.
Unﬂavoured water (still and sparkling), milk, tea and coffee have the ‘lowest
erosive potential’[footnote 27]. Although carbonated mineral water is more
acidic than still water, it is ﬁne for teeth, as long as it is unﬂavoured[footnote
27][footnote 31].
Whether the erosive potential translates into tooth wear depends on patient
factors and exposure conditions[footnote 33], including the length of time
involved[footnote 27], and number of acidic attacks per day[footnote 30][footnote
32].
There is also likely to be individual variation in response to the erosive
effects of acids, due to:
the quantity and quality of saliva9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 7: Tooth wear - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-7-tooth-wear 8/19features of the pellicle
individual habits which might include swishing, swilling, rinsing or holding
drinks in the mouth before swallowing (retention may prolong the effect
and overwhelm any protective capacity of saliva)[footnote 29]
the presence of calcium and phosphate in associated beverages and
foods[footnote 29]
lower frequency of toothbrushing with a ﬂuoride toothpaste[footnote 34]
individual susceptibility, for example, tooth anatomy and structure[footnote
5][footnote 34]
The most important aspect of patient care, once the presence of tooth wear
has been identiﬁed, is to identify all possible sources of risk, chemical
and/or mechanical, recognising that acids may be extrinsic or intrinsic,
healthy or unhealthy.
Current evidence suggests that in individuals who do not have a medical
condition or consume carbonated drinks, there may be other sources of
acid; which highlights the importance of detailed and careful dietary
investigation as part of risk factor identiﬁcation. It may therefore be helpful
to use the example diet diary
(https://khub.net/documents/135939561/516396401/Example+of+a+diet+diary.pdf/a
d68124b-edf1-7fa3-71f4-02e81149f5f1?t=1631880301380) (PDF, 76.6KB).
Whilst fruit is a possible healthy dietary risk factor, it has mainly been
identiﬁed amongst adults referred for specialist management of erosion in
dental hospitals, where eating fruit over an extended period was one of the
risk factors for severe erosive tooth wear[footnote 30].
Table 7.1 provides a list of possible factors which increase the risk of tooth
wear to explore with high risk patients. Several caveats are important.
Firstly, it has been compiled based on expert opinion and the best evidence
available on risks and their management. Secondly, further research is
required to better understand risk factors which may be multifactorial and
build evidence for their management. Thirdly, it is not a deﬁnitive or
exhaustive list.

• wine (white and red)
• alcopops and designer drinks
• fortiﬁed wines with fruity
ﬂavours
• smoothies
• energy drinks
• drinks containing citric acid,
including natural fruit juices –
such as orange, grapefruit,
lemon, blackcurrant
• fruit teas (excluding non-fruit
ﬂavoured herbal teas such as
camomile or peppermint)
• sports drinksLimit carbonated and acidic drinks to
meal-times.
Substitute with plain water or non-
ﬂavoured sparkling water.
Drink regular tea or coffee (without
sugar).
Reduce the temperature of fruit teas
or other hot erosive drinks – this slows
the erosion, but it’s preferable to swap
to a safer alternative.
Foods:
• vinegar-based foods, including
pickles
• fruit-based saucesLimit if consumed frequently.
Confectionary:
• acidic sweets, for example
sour jelly-based sweets, acid
drops, sherbet lemons, and so
on
• fruit-based sugar and certain
sugar free sweetsAvoid, or, for patients with reduced
salivary ﬂow, replace with sugar free
alternatives that have neutral pH
and/or are designed for dry mouth and
saliva stimulation.
Fruit (healthy acids):
• acidic fresh fruit, particularly in
high quantities
• lemons, oranges and
grapefruit are the most acidic
fruit acids (most fruits may be
erosive, other than banana and
avocado)Fruit eating should not be discouraged
unless identiﬁed as a risk factor.
Avoid grazing on fruit (only if this is
identiﬁed as a risk factor).
Substitute acidic fruit with vegetables,
bananas or avocados, particularly
between meals and ensure a wide
variety of vegetables.9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 7: Tooth wear - GOV.UK

Risk factor management: professional
action for high risk patients
Secondary prevention for patients with tooth wear should focus on
identifying, minimising or removing the source of risk, ideally at an early
stage as outlined in Chapter 2: Table 4
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-2-summary-guidance-tables-for-
dental-teams#table4). It is important to note that there are few clinical studies
assessing the prevention of tooth wear, particularly dental erosion, with the
majority of the evidence being of low certainty.
Patients should be active participants in identifying the main sources of risk
and in discussions about managing them. These conversations can be
sensitive and take time, since they may involve exploring lifestyle and even
expose possible mental health issues which require supportive referral. This
provides the basis for the provision of tailored, speciﬁc advice for each
individual patient, to manage their risks of tooth wear. Chapter 3
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-3-behaviour-change) on behaviour
change provides important tools for the dental team.
Professional consensus suggests that tackling intrinsic and extrinsic
sources of acid is more important than relying on adjustments relating to
toothpastes and toothbrushing. For high risk patients displaying signs of
accelerated tooth wear, focus on the main risk(s) of tooth wear such as diet,
medications and general health and help the patient to understand that such
changes will be of greater beneﬁt than possible sources of protection such
as specialised pastes. Evidence from insitu and invitro (laboratory) studies
suggests that specialised toothpastes containing ﬂuoride, or ﬂuoride plus a
stannous-based ingredient, can play a supplementary role in managing
erosive wear[footnote 41].9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 7: Tooth wear - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-7-tooth-wear 13/19Diet (including drinks)
Where there is evidence of dietary risk responsible for tooth wear, patients
should be advised to reduce the frequency of intake of the identiﬁed acidic
foods or drinks.
Keep the identiﬁed acidic food and drinks to mealtimes and explore safe
alternatives, particularly between meals.
Advise against methods of drinking that promote tooth wear such as swilling
and swishing.
Promote a healthy diet as outlined in Chapter 10
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-10-healthier-eating).
Toothbrushing
Use toothpaste containing an age-relevant ﬂuoride content twice daily as
outlined in Chapters 8 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-
better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-8-oral-hygiene)
and 9 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-9-ﬂuoride).
Avoid using high abrasive toothpaste.
Consider the use of specialised pastes containing ﬂuoride or ﬂuoride plus a
stannous-based ingredient.
There is no strong evidence to suggest that the timing of toothbrushing is of
great importance.
For people who experience vomiting on a frequent basis and wish to refresh
their mouth after vomiting, it may be helpful good practice to rinse the mouth
and apply ﬂuoride toothpaste, or a ﬂuoride mouthrinse.
General health
Medical advice and/or referral to their GP should be considered, if required,
for management of intrinsic sources of acid involving reﬂux or eating
disorders, or medications.9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 7: Tooth wear - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-7-tooth-wear 14/19Medications
Many people are on long-term medication which suppresses salivary ﬂow. It
is important to be aware of medications that reduce the ﬂow of saliva, and
thus impact on the clearance of acids and ensure regular medication is acid
free.
Saliva
Saliva may be a very important biological factor affecting the progression of
dental erosion[footnote 26], playing a role in dilution, buffering (chemically
lessening the impact) and clearance of dietary acids and supporting re-
mineraliation after an erosive challenge. Patients with reduced salivary ﬂow,
of any aetiology, may therefore be at increased risk of tooth wear. Active
encouragement in seeking medical support and considering saliva or
medication substitutes will be important.
Given the potential for erosive drinks to be a risk factor for tooth wear, the
use of drinking straws may be considered as part of risk management.
Current professional guidelines recommend the use of a wide bore straw,
plus avoidance of holding acidic drinks in the mouth[footnote 42]. There is
some weak evidence that straws are more likely to be beneﬁcial if
positioned to the back of the mouth to minimise contact between the drink
and the tooth surfaces[footnote 40]. However, there is insufﬁcient evidence to
know whether drinking through a straw does lead to a reduction in the risk
of tooth erosion given that people generally want to enjoy the taste of a
drink. Thus, any beneﬁt is likely to depend upon drinking behaviour and
positioning of the straw.
Monitoring tooth wear
Tooth wear is generally a slow process and may be episodic. Tools to help
monitor tooth wear progression include clinical assessment using indices if
it is early tooth wear; and if more severe, study models and photographs.
It is important to recognise that we do not yet have accurate methods for
measuring tooth wear over time; however, rapid advancement of digital
technologies such as intra-oral scans and registration may result in adjuncts
for monitoring tooth wear progression in clinical practice alongside history
taking and clinical judgement[footnote 43].9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 7: Tooth wear - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-7-tooth-wear 15/19Where accelerated tooth wear and its aetiology have been identiﬁed, it may
be helpful to consider a shortened dental recall period to support behaviour
change and to monitor progress of the condition.

Whilst this guidance seeks to ensure a consistent UK-wide approach to
prevention of oral diseases, some differences in operational delivery and
organisational responsibilities may apply in Wales, Northern Ireland and
England. In Scotland the guidance will be used to inform oral health
improvement policy.
Oral hygiene practices in the UK
Oral hygiene practices include toothbrushing and the use of other aids for
cleaning teeth. Toothbrushing is widely practiced across the UK. In a 2009
national survey of adults (https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-
information/publications/statistical/adult-dental-health-survey/adult-dental-health-
survey-2009-summary-report-and-thematic-series)[footnote 1], more women
reported cleaning their teeth at least twice a day than men (82% compared
with 67%). Three quarters (76%) of dentate adults reported using
toothpaste with 1,350 to 1,500 parts per million level of ﬂuoride and a further
18 per cent used a brand with a medium (1,000 to 1,350 parts per million)
ﬂuoride level. Most dentate adults (58%) used additional products as well as
a standard toothpaste and brush, the most common of which were
mouthwash (31%), powered toothbrushes (26%) and dental ﬂoss (21%).
Women and middle-aged adults were more likely to use additional products
than men, younger and very old adults (85 years and over).
A 2013 national survey[footnote 2] found that only a quarter of children
beneﬁted from having their teeth brushed before they were 6 months of age,
whereas about 50% had commenced between 6 months and one year of
age. Overall about 90% of children (aged 5 to 8 years) are reported as
having started toothbrushing by 2 years of age[footnote 2]. Overall, 77% of 12-
year-olds and 81% of 15-year-olds reported that they brushed their teeth
twice daily or more. Mouthwash was the most common aid other than a
toothbrush (manual or powered) and toothpaste. As expected, the use of
mouthwashes, dental ﬂoss (the only interdental cleaning method
investigated) and sugar-free gum was generally higher in older children.
Approximately 40% of the school children surveyed used a powered
toothbrush.9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 8: Oral hygiene - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-8-oral-hygiene 3/15Oral hygiene principles for oral health
Toothbrushing is important throughout life. The overall goal is to achieve
and maintain good oral hygiene as follows:
clean all tooth surfaces, and the gum line, thoroughly with a toothbrush
and ﬂuoride-containing toothpaste at least twice a day (last thing at night
or before bed and one other time), spitting out the excess toothpaste
use additional cleaning aids to reach interproximal surfaces, as
appropriate
The risk of dental caries (Chapter 4)
(https://gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-
based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-4-dental-caries) and periodontal diseases
(Chapter 5) (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-
health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-5-periodontal-diseases)
can both be reduced by the practice of regular careful oral hygiene involving
toothbrushing with ﬂuoride toothpaste. The particular beneﬁt in preventing
dental caries, relates to the ﬂuoride in toothpaste (Chapter 9)
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-9-ﬂuoride). Good oral hygiene
reduces the risk of periodontal diseases; however, periodontal health also
requires effective interproximal plaque removal. Oral hygiene advice for the
population in general, and speciﬁc advice for those at higher risk, are
presented below for each oral condition.
Dental caries
For caries prevention, it is the application of ﬂuoride in toothpaste that is the
most important aspect of brushing, as ﬂuoride helps prevent, control, and
arrest caries (Chapter 2: Table 1
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-2-summary-guidance-tables-for-
dental-teams#table1)). Higher concentration of ﬂuoride in toothpaste leads to
better caries control. Family or standard ﬂuoride toothpaste at 1,350 to
1,500 parts per million ﬂuoride (ppmF) is recommended, although in very
young children, where the ability to control swallowing is limited, a
toothpaste containing a lower amount (at least 1,000 ppmF) can be
used[footnote 3][footnote 4]. Frequency of brushing is important. Brushing
should occur twice daily as a minimum, the guidance being to clean teeth
last thing at night or before bed, and at least one other time each day. The
term ‘before bed’ may be used as an alternative to ‘last thing at night’ for
shift workers to sleep at another time of day.9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 8: Oral hygiene - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-8-oral-hygiene 4/15Early introduction to the habit of toothbrushing is important. Parents should
brush their children’s teeth as soon as they erupt. From 3 to 6 years of age,
there is a transition with the child and adult both brushing. Adult involvement
ensures the correct amount of toothpaste is used, enables them to prevent
children eating or licking toothpaste from the tube and that all teeth are
brushed thoroughly. From 7 years of age, many children can brush their
own teeth but will still require prompting, supervision, and motivation.
Parents may still need to provide help with toothbrushing for some children,
depending on risk and capability.
Gingivitis
Physical removal of plaque is the important element of toothbrushing for
preventing or controlling periodontal (gum) diseases for the general
population (Chapter 2: Table 2
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-2-summary-guidance-tables-for-
dental-teams#table2)). Self-care is important to maintain healthy gums and
manage any gingivitis; it reduces inﬂammation of the gingivae. It is
important to advise and instruct patients on good plaque removal from, and
just into, the gingival crevice, including interdental areas, which takes
around 2 minutes. There is no high-quality evidence regarding the best
times of the day to brush in order to maintain healthy gums; however, it is
good practice to suggest last thing at night or before bedtime and one other
time in line with caries prevention[footnote 3].
Periodontitis
Self-care is vitally important to prevent and manage plaque-induced
periodontitis[footnote 5] (Chapter 2: Table 2
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-2-summary-guidance-tables-for-
dental-teams#table2)). For people with periodontal diseases this becomes
vitally important throughout the rest of life and good oral hygiene may take
longer than the recommended 2 minutes. The patient’s existing method of
brushing may need to be modiﬁed to clean all tooth surfaces systematically,
maximise plaque removal and to brush the gum line carefully[footnote 6]. No
particular technique has been shown to be better than another[footnote 7].
Disclosing tablets can help to indicate areas that are being missed. For
people with extensive inﬂammation, it is good practice to start with
toothbrushing advice, followed by interdental plaque control[footnote 8].9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 8: Oral hygiene - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-8-oral-hygiene 5/15Cleaning between teeth, ideally with interdental brushes, is recommended
prior to toothbrushing as a habit-forming approach, which is considered to
be good practice[footnote 9] through adult life.
Based on current evidence, no strong conclusions can be drawn concerning
any speciﬁc oral hygiene devices as adjuncts to toothbrushing for patient
self-care in periodontal maintenance[footnote 5][^10], or method of providing
oral hygiene advice[footnote 11].
Tooth wear
General population advice
For the general population, advice on toothbrushing follows the generic
advice on oral health for prevention of dental caries and periodontal
diseases (Chapter 2: Table 4
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-2-summary-guidance-tables-for-
dental-teams#table4)). Although concerns have been raised, there is no
strong evidence to suggest that the timing of toothbrushing is of great
importance in preventing tooth wear or that all patients should delay
brushing until after meals involving erosive food and drinks[footnote 12].
Higher risk of tooth wear
For those at higher risk, changing to a low abrasive toothpaste or specially
reformulated toothpaste for tooth wear alone may be considered, but will not
be sufﬁcient to fully address tooth wear (Chapter 7)
(https://gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-
based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-7-tooth-wear). There have been debates
over whether to recommend manual or powered toothbrushes. Many
brushes now have sensors to indicate when the user is brushing too hard.
However, when it comes to tooth wear, there is no evidence to suggest that
powered toothbrushes are any better, or worse, than manual
toothbrushes[footnote 13]. Patient preference is therefore the most important
factor over whether a powered or manual toothbrush is used.
Oral hygiene advice
Effective toothbrushing with a ﬂuoride toothpaste is important to support oral
health. The physical action of brushing removes plaque, which prevents
gingivitis and periodontitis, and the ﬂuoride in toothpaste is effective against9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 8: Oral hygiene - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-8-oral-hygiene 6/15tooth decay. The following key messages for the population include when
and how to brush, speciﬁc habits associated with brushing, and, where
necessary, assistance with brushing. There may be adaptations of
toothbrushes, such as special grip handles, that are helpful to people who
have limited manual dexterity.
Advice for the population (primary prevention)
Advice to prevent oral disease in general should, therefore, focus on the
following points[footnote 3][footnote 4]:
brush all tooth surfaces at least twice a day (last thing at night or bedtime
and on at least one other occasion), with ﬂuoride toothpaste
ensure that every surface of each tooth and the junction between the gum
and tooth (gumline) are cleaned carefully
for young people and adults, the patient’s existing method of brushing
may need to be modiﬁed to maximise plaque removal, emphasising the
need to systematically clean all tooth surfaces
both powered and manual toothbrushes are effective for plaque
control[footnote 14]
there is low-certainty evidence that medium and soft bristle brushes are
less likely to cause gingival lesions than hard bristle toothbrushes[footnote
15]; for most patients, an appropriate brush will be a small-headed
toothbrush with medium texture bristles
the type of toothbrush ﬁlament does not appear to be clinically important
in plaque removal[footnote 15][footnote 16]
daily interproximal plaque removal should have started by age 18 years,
or younger, if gingival inﬂammation is present
thorough cleaning may take at least 2 minutes[footnote 3]; the main
rationale for this time period is to ensure that sufﬁcient time is taken for all
tooth surfaces to be cleaned effectively[footnote 17]
timers, which range from simple ‘egg-timers’ to clocks incorporated into
toothbrushes and downloadable ‘apps’, can be helpful to assist with the
length of time toothbrushing[footnote 3][footnote 17]
disclosing agents can help to indicate areas of the mouth that are being
missed and guide the person to more effective brushing
Advice for children in the population (primary
prevention)9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 8: Oral hygiene - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-8-oral-hygiene 7/15Advice should include the following:
brushing should start as soon as the ﬁrst primary tooth erupts using
toothpaste containing at least 1,000 ppmF[footnote 3][footnote 4]
parents or carers should use no more than a smear of toothpaste
(https://gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-
based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-9-ﬂuoride#smear) (a thin ﬁlm of paste
covering less than three-quarters of the child’s brush) for children below 3
years of age[footnote 17]
parents or carers should use no more than a pea-sized amount of
toothpaste (https://gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-
an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-9-ﬂuoride#blob) for children
between 3 and 6 years[footnote 18]
parents or carers should brush their young children’s teeth. In the
absence of evidence from home settings, expert opinion suggests that
they need to be helped and supervised by an adult, when brushing, until
at least 7 years of age (based on ﬁndings from supervised brushing at
schools which show signiﬁcant caries reduction)[footnote 19]
parental supervision in the early years can also ensure that children do
not eat or lick toothpaste from the tube (or brush), use the correct amount
of toothpaste, and brush in a systematic pattern around the mouth[footnote
20]
as soon as they are able (usually around the age of 3 years), children
should be encouraged to spit out excess toothpaste, and not to rinse with
water after brushing
from 7 years of age, many children can brush their own teeth but will still
require supervision, motivation, and possibly assistance
for children at higher risk of oral disease, a family ﬂuoride toothpaste
(1,350 to 1,500 ppmF) is indicated for maximum caries control, except
where children cannot be prevented from eating toothpaste[footnote 3]
[footnote 4]
Advice for those with evidence of periodontitis or
higher risk (secondary and tertiary prevention)
Advice should include the following:
cleaning at the gum level is particularly important for people with
experience of periodontitis
interdental cleaning aids help reach interproximal surfaces[footnote 8], and
it may possibly be helpful to use them before toothbrushing[footnote 9]
in general, people with, or treated for, periodontitis will have larger
interdental spaces due to tissue loss, and should use interdental brushes,9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 8: Oral hygiene - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-8-oral-hygiene 8/15which are more effective than dental ﬂoss or tape[footnote 21]
the interdental brush should ﬁt snuggly in the interdental space; therefore,
many people with periodontitis will require different sizes for smaller and
larger spaces – where the teeth are closer together, ﬂoss or tape can be
used for interdental cleaning[footnote 5]
regular re-evaluation of oral hygiene will be helpful for some patients with
appropriate level of support from dental professionals[footnote 5][footnote 22]
Additional considerations
partially dentate older adults would particularly beneﬁt from additional
attention to oral hygiene, particularly those wearing partial
dentures[footnote 23], as they increase plaque retention
good denture hygiene is important for those with partial and/or complete
dentures as demonstrated in mouthcare matters
(https://mouthcarematters.hee.nhs.uk/)
Speciﬁc oral hygiene issues for
vulnerable children and adults
Vulnerable children and adults, particularly those lacking manual dexterity
and mental capacity, may require assistance and support with toothbrushing
as part of their daily self-care. Oral hygiene care and advice for people who
have learning disabilities should be based on professional expertise and the
needs and preferences of the individual and their carers[footnote 24]. They
may beneﬁt from using a powered brush[footnote 24], and some will require
modiﬁcations such as a grip handle to assist with toothbrushing. The latter
may also be useful for people with physical disabilities. There is low/very
low certainty evidence for the effectiveness of triple-headed manual
toothbrushes for reducing plaque compared to single-headed
brushes[footnote 25]. Carers of people lacking the ability to undertake their
personal oral hygiene may consider some of these products helpful and
they are likely to require training and support from the dental team. It is
worth noting that some studies reported participant difﬁculties with, or fears
of, using the powered or the 3-headed manual toothbrushes[footnote 24]; thus,
they won’t be helpful for some patients.
NICE guidance on oral health for adults in care homes stresses the
importance of ensuring care staff provide residents with daily support to
meet their mouth care needs and preferences, as set out in their personal
care plan after their oral health assessment[footnote 26].9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 8: Oral hygiene - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-8-oral-hygiene 9/15This should include:
providing daily oral care for full or partial dentures (such as brushing,
removing food debris, and removing dentures overnight)
using their choice of cleaning products for dentures if possible
using their choice of toothbrush, either manual or powered
daily use of mouth care products prescribed by dental clinicians (for
example, this may include a high ﬂuoride toothpaste or a prescribed
mouthwash or rinse[footnote 27]
Powered versus manual toothbrushes
There is moderate-certainty evidence to suggest that powered toothbrushes
reduce plaque and gingivitis more than manual toothbrushing in the short
and long term, and supporting their safety[footnote 28]. Findings are
consistent across reviews, favouring powered brushes but the clinical
relevance of the results is unclear[footnote 14][footnote 29][footnote 30][footnote 31].
This is particularly important to note as many people will not be able to
afford a powered toothbrush and it should be stressed that teeth can be
cleaned effectively with either type of toothbrush[footnote 32]. Additionally, the
evidence is insufﬁcient to conclude that any particular mode of action of
powered brush is superior (for example, sonic, rotatory)[footnote 33]. There is
no evidence regarding the role of powered versus manual toothbrushes in
preventing caries.
Interdental cleaning
Periodontal health
There is low to very low-certainty evidence that using some dental cleaning
aids in addition to tooth cleaning (for example, interdental brushes and
ﬂoss) reduce gingivitis and plaque, but the clinical importance of the effect
sizes is uncertain[footnote 8]. The ﬁndings suggest that interdental brushes
may be more effective than ﬂoss and the evidence for tooth cleaning sticks
and oral irrigators is limited and inconsistent[footnote 8]. Daily cleaning is
recommended between the teeth to below the gum line[footnote 8]. Ideally this
should take place throughout adult life and start earlier if there are signs of
gingivitis. Since toothbrushing is a daily routine for the majority of people,9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 8: Oral hygiene - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-8-oral-hygiene 10/15carrying out interdental oral hygiene ﬁrst may help to link these activities
and develop regularity[footnote 9].
Dental caries
Recommendations relating to interdental brushing and ﬂossing are based
on trials at unclear or high risk of bias that focus on the reporting of plaque
and/or gingivitis, rather than caries. Thus, there is no evidence to determine
whether interdental cleaning aids reduce caries, or not, when compared
with toothbrushing alone[footnote 8].
Sustainable toothbrushes
The sustainability agenda, which is an important aspect of public health
action, has implications for the prevention or oral diseases. It is increasingly
inﬂuencing the nature of new products arriving on the market, some of
which have relatively little underpinning research.
For example, switching from traditional plastic toothbrushes to replaceable-
head plastic or bamboo has been suggested as being environmentally more
sustainable. However, all choices have trade-offs which should be
considered carefully. Bamboo toothbrushes are manufactured in different
parts of the world, and although they have been shown to have a reduced
carbon footprint[footnote 34], they have also been shown to have high
planetary harm, due to the need for land, and volume of water required to
grow the product. Furthermore, there is currently little evidence on their
effectiveness. On the other hand, plastic has been considered the most
hygienic option for decades. Additionally, all toothbrushes, whether normal
plastic, bamboo, and biodegradable plastic (PLA or polylactic acid), have
brush heads containing metal and/or nylon, so it is currently not possible to
recycle the heads.
Further innovative new products will emerge, and it will be important for
health professionals to be aware of these changes and consider the clinical
effectiveness of sustainable products. Integrating oral health and
sustainability is attractive, and continually recycled plastic, rather than
bioplastic or bamboo, will be the most environmentally sustainable
toothbrush model[footnote 35]. Practices may wish to encourage patients to
recycle toothbrushes as best as possible. As a compromise, it may be
possible for people to remove or chop off the brush head and recycle the
handle. Some dental practices already have an arrangement with
companies to recycle any type of toothbrush and toothpaste tubes.9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 8: Oral hygiene - GOV.UK

Introduction
Dental caries is one of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases
nationally[footnote 1][footnote 2] and globally[footnote 3]. The disease is caused by
dietary sugars that are broken down by micro-organisms in the bioﬁlm on a
tooth surface, which produces acids that, over time, demineralise tooth
enamel[footnote 4][footnote 5].
The process of de- and re-mineralisation is dynamic[footnote 4]. In the early
stages of the disease, dental caries can be reversed. However, when
factors promoting demineralisation exceed those favouring remineralisation,
dental caries progresses (unless checked) into dentine to a point where the
tooth surface breaks down and ultimately a cavity forms[footnote 5].
Effective patient care involves ﬁrst diagnosing the presence and recording
the extent of disease, using contemporary dental caries management tools
such as the International Caries Classiﬁcation and Management System
(ICCMS)[footnote 6], encouraging a reduction of factors that cause
demineralisation, notably sugar consumption; and, enhancement of those
favouring remineralisation, particularly the availability of ﬂuoride and mineral
ions. This may be achieved by a combination of preventive actions taken by
patients, patient carers and healthcare professionals, supported by higher-
level actions that promote policies and active change to facilitate a less
cariogenic social environment.
Epidemiology9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 4: Dental caries - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-4-dental-caries 3/14The prevalence of dental caries in children in the UK has reduced
dramatically over the past 5 decades[footnote 7]. This is generally attributed to
the introduction of ﬂuoride-containing toothpaste in the early 1970s[footnote
4]. Other factors such as changed social attitudes, access to dental care,
developments in preventive dental materials, together with health promoting
and clinical practices have also contributed to these changes over time. Yet
dental caries, which is largely preventable, remains prevalent and
inequalities are marked[footnote 8].
Surveys of oral health in adults within the UK[footnote 9] suggest that there
are 3 cohorts in the population:
the oldest cohort, who have lost all their teeth, and wear complete
dentures
a middle cohort, who retain most of their teeth, but do so largely because
of the efforts of the dental profession who have restored and maintained
teeth in those who grew up before ﬂuoride toothpaste became widely
available
the youngest cohort, many of whom are caries-free in their early years
In the immediate future, the number of edentulous people will continue to
fall. Therefore, more adults will enter older age with some or all of their
natural teeth, many of which will be heavily restored. Dental caries is not
just a disease of children and young people, new carious lesions can
develop at any age. Dental professionals therefore need to be vigilant and
take appropriate action to support all patients, irrespective of age, based on
their dental caries risk.
Root caries is increasingly a cause for concern and lifelong coronal caries
experience is a risk factor for root surface caries experience[footnote 10]. Root
caries increases with age and amongst independently living older adults,
factors such as poor plaque control, xerostomia, coronal decay and having
exposed root surfaces are indicators of risk[footnote 11].
Like many common chronic lifestyle-associated diseases, the prevalence of
dental caries is linked with social and economic circumstances[footnote 12]
[footnote 13], and ethnicity, with the prevalence of dental caries higher in some
ethnic groups. It is, however, recognised that there is a complex interplay
between these determinants. Whilst some of the variation in disease levels
can be accounted for by deprivation (circa 41% amongst 5 year olds)[footnote
12], it is not the only risk factor and dental team members play an important
role in identifying modiﬁable risks and helping individuals to recognise and
minimise these risks, and enhance protective factors.
Dental caries risk9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 4: Dental caries - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-4-dental-caries 4/14Assessing the level of dental caries risk for an individual patient is key to
tailoring appropriate preventive care as outlined in Chapter 2: Table 1
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-2-summary-guidance-tables-for-
dental-teams#table1). Based on extensive research, dental caries risk
assessment tools have been developed, but these can be complex and time
consuming to administer. Risk identiﬁcation based on a single risk or
protective factor has limitations due to the multifactorial nature of dental
caries. The presence of dental caries in the past is a good predictor of
dental caries experience in the future, and the overall clinical judgement of a
dental professional who has a general sense of an individual’s lifestyle and
life-circumstances is vital[footnote 14].
Dental professionals should consider which patients are at higher risk of
dental caries. People at higher risk include children presenting with tooth
decay; children who have had dental caries in their primary dentition and
ﬁrst permanent molars and those who have been admitted to hospital for
removal of their teeth; as well as certain children who are medically
compromised or have a disability. Amongst adults, people with medically
compromising conditions or disabilities and older adults, particularly as they
become physically or cognitively impaired, are at higher risk as well as
people with active caries. This includes people for whom the treatment of
dental caries can be difﬁcult or present a risk to health.
Additionally, there may be patients with speciﬁc teeth or areas of their
mouth at higher risk of developing dental caries. For example,
hypomineralised teeth are at increased risk of dental caries in
children[footnote 15]. Also, adults with partially erupted third molars are at
higher risk of developing dental caries in the impacted third molar itself or in
the case of mesioangular impacted third molars, on the distal surface of the
preceding second molar tooth[footnote 16][footnote 17][footnote 18][footnote 19].
These risks should be clearly identiﬁed and explained to patients.
Oral healthcare professionals should work with patients to assess their
dental caries risk and support them to manage their oral health effectively
as part of person-centred care.
The challenge for oral healthcare professionals is to:
ensure everyone receives universal preventive advice and support
identify those children and young people who are at higher risk of dental
caries and provide additional preventive care
identify and provide additional support to those at higher risk in an ageing
population with existing restorations, advanced prostheses and the co-
morbidities that come with old age
identify individuals for whom dental care would be particularly difﬁcult
identify speciﬁc teeth which would beneﬁt from speciﬁc preventive action
and support9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 4: Dental caries - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-4-dental-caries 5/14Risk and protective factors
The main modiﬁable risk factors for dental caries are diet, consuming too
much cariogenic sugar too often, and lack of optimal ﬂuoride.
The key recommendations and good practice points to prevent dental caries
are in the summary guidance
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-2-summary-guidance-tables-for-
dental-teams#table1) (Chapter 2: Table 1) with further details in the following
chapters:
Fluoride (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-
health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-9-ﬂuoride) and Oral
hygiene (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-
health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-8-oral-hygiene)
(Chapters 9 and 8)
Healthier eating (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-
oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-10-healthier-eating)
(Chapter 10)
Other dental caries risk and protective factors, including addressing
medicine containing sugars or reducing salivary ﬂow, placing ﬁssure
sealants, chewing sugar-free gum and using topical remineralising agents
and varnishes, are addressed below.
Medicines
Liquid, chewable or soluble medications containing sugars, either provided
on prescription or bought over the counter, may contribute to the frequency,
and possibly volume, of an individual’s sugar intake. This presents a
challenge as people who are likely to be taking long-term medications in
liquid format are likely to be at increased risk of dental caries or from dental
treatment that may be required, most notably children with chronic illnesses,
people with special needs, or vulnerable older adults.
Children with chronic conditions such as epilepsy may require liquid
medication for a long time. Frequent liquid medications can also be taken
for common conditions including pain relief, infections, coughs and colds.
There is some evidence that due to generic prescribing, a large proportion
of the medications dispensed for possible long-term use in older adults are
sugar-containing liquid oral medicines[footnote 20].
Sugar-free medicines, where available, may play an important role in the
long-term care of such patients. Products that do not contain fructose,9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 4: Dental caries - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-4-dental-caries 6/14glucose or sucrose are listed as being sugar-free. Preparations containing
artiﬁcial sweeteners such as hydrogenated glucose syrup, lycasin, maltitol,
sorbitol or xylitol are also listed as sugar-free, since there is evidence that
they are non-cariogenic[footnote 21].
Where a patient is on a long-term liquid or soluble medication that is not
sugar-free, clinical teams are advised to check the British National
Formulary (BNF) – NICE (https://bnf.nice.org.uk/) to determine if sugar-free
alternatives are available.
Where a sugar-free version is available, the clinician should write to the
patient’s general medical practitioner to ask if they can change the
prescription to the sugar-free version, explaining the reason for the request.
Patients that are dentate and on long-term medication that is not sugar-free,
and where sugar-free alternatives are not available, should be advised
where possible to try to take medications at mealtimes. This may not be
realistic if there are speciﬁc instructions such as taking medications on an
empty stomach, or carers are only permitted to distribute medicines at
speciﬁc times.
Parents should also be advised to discuss with pharmacists if sugar-free
versions of over the counter liquid medications are available for their
children.
Methadone, used in the rehabilitation of drug users, is available as a sugar-
free preparation. However, the sugar-based version is most often
used[footnote 22][footnote 23] due to issues of cost and practicalities. Whilst
clinicians have raised concerns about the risk of developing dental caries,
empirical research has not been undertaken. High-quality studies are
required to assess the adverse effects of methadone on oral health[footnote
24].
It is increasingly recognised that certain medicines may reduce salivary
ﬂow, which therefore raises patient risk of developing dental caries. Again, it
is helpful to discuss these issues with patients and where appropriate, liaise
with their medical practitioner or specialist.
In older adults, polypharmacy leading to xerostomia is a signiﬁcant risk
factor for dental caries, as well as sugared oral nutritional supplements. This
includes therapeutic foods which may be in milkshake type liquids which are
extremely common within care homes to provide vitamins, minerals and
calories to prevent further weight loss. There is a general trend towards
more liquid medication, particularly in relation to end-of-life care. Analysis of
recent NHS prescribing data
(https://khub.net/documents/135939561/516396401/Oral_liquid_prescribing_NHS_E
ngland.xlsx/edf3d686-d265-8951-521e-0eb2b6e3cfce) (in England) is available
online. It will not always be practical, or appropriate, to consider alternatives
to these sugar-based supplements and medications because of more9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 4: Dental caries - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-4-dental-caries 7/14pressing health concerns; and, in such cases, dental professionals are
encouraged to place greater emphasis on risk management using ﬂuoride
(Chapter 9) (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-
health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-9-ﬂuoride).
People prescribed liquid medications are likely to be in dependent sections
of the population including young children, people with special needs and
older adults. Whether the use of the medication is short-term or long-term, it
is vital to take their general health and wellbeing into account on prescribing
these medications. The top 5 most prescribed medications in England
include lactulose and morphine sulphate oral solutions, both of which
contain sugar (see list of oral liquid prescribing medication
(https://khub.net/documents/135939561/516396401/Oral_liquid_prescribing_NHS_E
ngland.xlsx/edf3d686-d265-8951-521e-0eb2b6e3cfce)). These are commonly
used to manage short and long term illnesses: constipation, hepatic
encephalopathy and acute or chronic pain and palliative care in older
people. If the medication use is long-term, then recognition of sugar-
containing oral liquid medication is important. It is important to explore with
patients, and their carers or medical team, whether sugar-free options are
available and can be tolerated. Alternatively it will be helpful to ﬁnd ways in
which the protective effects of ﬂuoride may be optimised to manage dental
caries risk and maintain the patient’s overall health.
Pit and ﬁssure sealants
Pit and ﬁssure sealants have been used in the prevention and control of
dental caries on permanent teeth for decades[footnote 25]. A range of
materials and techniques exist, with new ones continuing to emerge.
Materials include resin-based, glass ionomer, polyacid-modiﬁed resin and
resin-modiﬁed glass-ionomer cements.
When compared with unsealed teeth, there is moderate-certainty evidence
that resin-based ﬁssure sealants are effective in preventing and arresting
dental caries for up to 48 months [footnote 26]. The evidence for glass-
ionomer based sealants is inconclusive[footnote 26].
In line with the philosophy that children at increased risk of dental caries
should receive additional preventive interventions, it is strongly
recommended that resin-based sealants be applied on eruption of
permanent teeth, particularly molar teeth, if a child is judged by the clinician
to be at higher risk of dental caries.
Whilst there is limited research evidence on the beneﬁts of proximal
sealants, it would seem best practice to seal a surface if it is exposed and at
risk. For example, the mesial surface of a ﬁrst permanent molar may be
sealed when the deciduous molar has been lost; or when a surface is9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 4: Dental caries - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-4-dental-caries 8/14exposed, whilst carrying out an interproximal restoration on an adjacent
tooth.
The placement of sealants is highly technique-sensitive, with poor operative
technique and/or a challenging environment affecting the retention of the
sealant and therefore its success[footnote 27]. It is important to check sealants
for wear, integrity and leakage at every visit and re-seal where necessary to
maintain their role in caries prevention.
Sugar-free chewing gum
The use of sugar-free chewing gum (SFG) has been suggested as a dental
caries-inhibiting activity. A recent systematic review provided tentative
evidence that chewing SFG reduces dental caries increment compared to
‘not chewing’[footnote 28]. However, there was a considerable degree of
variability in the effect and the trials included were generally of moderate
quality. The review concluded that there is a need for future research to
explore the acceptability and feasibility of the use of SFG as a public health
intervention[footnote 28]. The National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE) guidance on oral health for adults in care homes does
include SFG as an option for dental caries risk management amongst
dentate frail older adults in care homes[footnote 29].
Re-mineralising agents other than ﬂuoride
Topical re-mineralising agents have been available, either on prescription
from dentists or over-the-counter, for several years now. They are mainly
used for patients with high dental caries risk, as an adjunct to normal
therapies, including high-concentration ﬂuoride dentifrices. It is suggested
that these agents are effective in re-mineralising early enamel lesions in
high risk patients[footnote 30]. Typical constituents include casein
phosphopeptide (an amorphous calcium phosphate) that helps bind the re-
mineralising ions to the bioﬁlm as well as modulating bioﬁlm pH and
bacterial colonisation.
Chlorhexidine varnish
Further research in this area is required, but it may be helpful to consider
chlorhexidine varnish (CHX-V) in circumstances where ﬂuoride (Chapter 9)
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 4: Dental caries - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-4-dental-caries 9/14evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-9-ﬂuoride) is not possible. There is
currently limited evidence regarding the use of CHX-V for the prevention of
root caries in older people and adults with xerostomia. A recent systematic
review[footnote 31], involving just 3 studies, evaluated CXH-V in relation to a
placebo. They reported weak evidence that CHX-V, applied by a
professional to exposed roots (3 monthly application; 1% and 10%),
reduces the initiation of root caries lesions and the dental caries activity of
existing lesions.
Early detection and management
pathways
Given that dental caries can be identiﬁed and is reversible at an early stage,
lesions should be identiﬁed at an early stage and managed. There is no
evidence that a speciﬁc dental recall interval inﬂuences dental caries
development or progression.
The time between dental check-ups should be based on risk, as assessed
by the clinician, working with patients (and where appropriate parents or
guardians) and will be inﬂuenced by preventive care needed. The recall
period will change across the life course[footnote 32][footnote 33], as shown in
Chapter 1 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-
health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-1-introduction). For
example, in children it is good practice for the recall period to be set so that
they can obtain optimal prevention through treatments such as the
application of ﬂuoride varnish.
For older adults in care homes, having an oral health assessment on entry
to the care home is recommended in NG48 by NICE[footnote 29], supported
by access to professional care on a regular basis. Given that these people
will be at higher risk of most oral diseases and conditions, shortened recall
periods are likely to be the norm.

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-9-ﬂuoride 2/17This guidance is issued jointly by the Department of Health and Social Care,
the Welsh Government, the Department of Health Northern Ireland, Public
Health England, NHS England and NHS Improvement, and with the support
of the British Association for the Study of Community Dentistry.
Delivering Better Oral Health has been developed with the support of the 4
UK Chief Dental Ofﬁcers.
Whilst this guidance seeks to ensure a consistent UK-wide approach to
prevention of oral diseases, some differences in operational delivery and
organisational responsibilities may apply in Wales, Northern Ireland and
England. In Scotland the guidance will be used to inform oral health
improvement policy.
Fluoride and dental caries prevention
Fluorides are widely found in nature and in products such as tea, ﬁsh, beer
and in some natural water supplies. The link between ﬂuoride in public
water supplies and reduced levels of dental caries was ﬁrst documented
early in the last century. Since then ﬂuoride has become more widely
available, most notably in toothpaste, and recognised as having improved
oral health in the UK. The decline of dental caries worldwide over recent
decades is largely attributed to the daily use of ﬂuoride toothpaste[footnote 1].
There is abundant evidence that increasing ﬂuoride availability to individuals
and communities is effective at reducing dental caries levels (Chapter 2:
Table 1 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-
an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-2-summary-guidance-tables-for-
dental-teams#table1); Chapter 4
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-4-dental-caries)). For example,
moving from brushing once a day to twice a day lowers an individual’s risk
of developing dental caries by 14%[footnote 2].
Regular exposure to ﬂuoride maintains a concentration in the plaque bioﬁlm
that encourages remineralisation of the tooth surface. This can be achieved
by a range of methods, but similar principles apply to all. Fluoride delivery
using vehicles that can be incorporated into aspects of everyday living are
more likely to be effective and they avoid increasing inequalities.
The risk of ingesting too much ﬂuoride leading to ﬂuorosis should be
considered for young children during tooth formation[footnote 3]. A balance
has to be achieved, whereby, most beneﬁt can be gained from this naturally
occurring substance, whilst at the same time minimising the risk of ﬂuorosis.9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 9: Fluoride - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-9-ﬂuoride 3/17Water ﬂuoridation
Currently, approximately 10% of England’s population, or about 6 million
people, have a ﬂuoridatated water supply. In terms of population coverage,
the West Midlands is the most extensively ﬂuoridated area, followed by
parts of the North East of England (Figure 9.1).
There are no ﬂuoridation schemes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland,
however, there are some localised areas of naturally occurring ﬂuoride in
the water. To check if the water supply in a given area is ﬂuoridated,
information can be obtained from the local water supplier by quoting the
residential postcode. Many water companies have an online function to
allow consumers to check the level of ﬂuoride.
Figure 9.1. Map of ﬂuoridated areas in England
Milk ﬂuoridation
There are a few community schemes in England which supply children with
ﬂuoridated milk at early years and school settings. They are provided in
areas that are not ﬂuoridated and where levels of dental caries are high. In
2016 an evidence review and guide for local authorities commissioning
programmes such as ﬂuoridated milk classiﬁed these as of limited value for
oral health[footnote 4].9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 9: Fluoride - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-9-ﬂuoride 4/17Increasing ﬂuoride availability
Information on how ﬂuoride availability can be increased on an individual
basis to improve oral health follows below. This can involve a range of
behaviours and modes of delivery, linking closely, but not exclusively, to oral
hygiene practices. Concentration, frequency and mode of delivery of
ﬂuoride are important, together with practical action to ensure that ﬂuoride
stays in the oral cavity and is not rinsed away.
Fluoride toothpaste
Toothpaste is the most common delivery system for ﬂuoride and comes in a
range of strengths, ﬂavours and formulations. For further details on
toothbrushing please see Chapter 8
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-8-oral-hygiene) on oral hygiene .
There is moderate to high-certainty evidence that ﬂuoride toothpaste of
1,000 ppm ﬂuoride or above prevents dental caries in both the permanent
and primary dentition[footnote 5]. For children at higher risk, 1,350 to 1,500
ppm is advocated and also for children from 7 years upwards[footnote 5].
The formulation of ﬂuoride in toothpaste varies and can take various forms,
for example, sodium ﬂuoride, sodium monoﬂuorophosphate, stannous
ﬂuoride, or a combination of these. However, currently, there is insufﬁcient
evidence to conﬁdently recommend one over another. It is the strength in
parts per million ﬂuoride (which can be found on the packaging) that is
important[footnote 5], along with consideration of wider dental caries risk
factors, particularly sugar in the diet.
It is important to brush at least twice a day with ﬂuoride toothpaste, last
thing at night or before bedtime and one other time[footnote 5][footnote 6]. It is
also helpful to recognise that a combination of health behaviours such as
using higher ﬂuoride paste, brushing twice a day and avoiding rinsing after
brushing appears to be associated with reducing the dental caries
increment in adolescents[footnote 2].
Types of over-the-counter toothpastes by ﬂuoride concentration level
A table of currently available toothpastes and their ﬂuoride content
(https://khub.net/documents/135939561/516396401/Fluoride_content_of_toothpaste
s.xlsx/747e70d8-bb73-df61-5d72-15fb930cd25a?t=1632213336398) is provided
for information. The list is not an endorsement of any particular brand.
Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the list is comprehensive, and
correct at the time (January 2020), it may not represent all brands of
toothpaste available in the UK. Analysis of toothpastes suggested that9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 9: Fluoride - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-9-ﬂuoride 5/17almost one-third (31%) of available toothpastes contained no ﬂuoride and
4% had an unrecorded concentration[footnote 7]. Information is not available
about levels of ﬂuoride in brands bought from places such as single price
stores, markets, websites and car boot sales, which may be special imports
or, on occasion counterfeit, and not contain any ﬂuoride. Such toothpaste
may not offer protection against dental caries. There is increasing diversity
in the toothpaste market with greater emphasis on whitening, natural, and
holistic health products. This trend highlights the importance of dental
professionals taking time to recognise the changing market, explore with
patients what toothpastes they are using, and why, in order to assist them in
selection of an appropriate product.
Higher dose ﬂuoride toothpaste
The maximum concentration of ﬂuoride-containing toothpaste that can be
purchased over the counter in the UK is 1,500 ppm ﬂuoride. Higher dose
toothpastes are available on prescription from a dentist. Evidence on the
efﬁcacy of higher dose ﬂuoride toothpastes is limited[footnote 5] and available
studies focus on root caries[footnote 8]. Dentists may wish to consider higher
concentration ﬂuoride toothpastes for vulnerable young people and adults
susceptible to dental caries[footnote 9]. Dental caries risk should be reviewed
at routine oral health assessments and high ﬂuoride toothpaste only
continued for those who are unable to reduce their susceptibility to dental
caries.
Prescribing higher dose ﬂuoride toothpaste
The following sections provide information and advice on ﬂuoride
prescription including examples of prescription scripts. It is important to
avoid chronic and/or acute ingestion of ﬂuoride; however, occurrences of
excessive ﬂuoride ingestion in adults from high ﬂuoride toothpastes are very
rare[footnote 10]. Adults should be advised to follow the instructions under
which these medications are licensed which recommends a 2cm ribbon on
toothbrush head 3 times daily. As with children, adults should be
encouraged to spit out excess toothpaste and avoid rinsing. Adults with
limited capacity should be supported in toothbrushing to ensure that they
use the recommended amount only.
Sodium ﬂuoride 2,800 ppm ﬂuoride toothpaste
Indications for use include high dental caries risk patients aged 10 years
and over. This includes those with dental caries present, a high cariogenic
diet or cariogenic medication. Whilst this approach may be helpful as dental
caries risk is tackled, most patients will beneﬁt from reducing their sugar
intake in the longer term. However, it may be necessary to continue with
high ﬂuoride toothpaste where patients are unable to reduce their
susceptibility to dental caries. For example of a prescription, please see
Figure 9.2 below.9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 9: Fluoride - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-9-ﬂuoride 6/17Figure 9.2. Prescription for higher dose ﬂuoride toothpaste 2800ppm
Sodium ﬂuoride 5,000 ppm toothpaste
Indications for use include high dental caries risk patients aged 16 years
and over. This includes those with root or coronal caries present or risk
factors such as dry mouth, overdentures, those with a highly cariogenic diet
or cariogenic medication and those who have received head and neck
radiotherapy and chemotherapy[footnote 5][footnote 11]. Again, this should be
used in conjunction with reducing sugar intake, subject to review and not
normally for the long term, except in speciﬁc circumstances. For example of
a prescription please see Figure 9.3 below.9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 9: Fluoride - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-9-ﬂuoride 7/17Figure 9.3. Prescription for higher dose ﬂuoride toothpaste 5000ppm
Toothpaste taste, texture and foaming
The taste of toothpaste varies between brands and countries and is
inﬂuenced by the target market. While fruit ﬂavoured toothpastes aimed at
children are available, as the majority of family toothpastes are mint
ﬂavoured, it is recommended to start young children on a mild mint family
toothpaste. If fruit ﬂavoured toothpastes are chosen, extra care must be
taken to ensure that children do not eat or swallow the toothpaste because
they like the taste. Transition to mint ﬂavoured paste should therefore be
encouraged as soon as the child will tolerate this taste.
Toothpaste taste can be a barrier to regular use, particularly in children with
sensory sensitivities, including autism and learning disabilities who may
beneﬁt from a paste that is less ﬂavoured or foaming.
People who have a vulnerable airway, for example if they have experienced
a stroke or are on a ventilator, or some adults and children with special
needs (such as sensory sensitivities, dysphagia, dry mouth, cognitive
decline, having nil by mouth) will beneﬁt from a toothpaste that produces
less foam[footnote 12][footnote 13]. Thus they would beneﬁt from toothpaste that
is free from sodium lauryl sulphate. Examples of such products can be
found in the Mouthcare Matters product list.9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 9: Fluoride - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-9-ﬂuoride 8/17Fluoride varnish
Fluoride varnish is one of the best options for increasing the availability of
topical ﬂuoride regardless of the levels of ﬂuoride in any water supply[footnote
14]. This should happen when a child visits a dental surgery and is strongly
recommended[footnote 14]. The dental caries-preventive effectiveness of
ﬂuoride varnish in both permanent and primary dentitions is clear[footnote 14]
[footnote 15]. Several systematic reviews conclude that applications twice a
year produce an average reduction in dental caries increment of 37% in the
primary and 43% in the permanent dentition[footnote 14]. Much of the
evidence of effectiveness is derived from studies which have used sodium
ﬂuoride 22,600 ppm (2.26% NaF) varnish for application.
Fluoride varnish for use as a topical treatment has several practical
advantages. It is well accepted and safe for most patients (see exceptions
below). Furthermore, the application of ﬂuoride varnish is simple and can be
applied by trained and competent members of the oral healthcare team
including dental nurses. While a thorough prophylaxis is not essential prior
to application, removal of gross plaque is advised. Dental nurses can be
trained to apply ﬂuoride varnish to the prescription of a dentist and this use
of team skill mix can assist a practice to become more preventively
orientated[footnote 16]. A detailed protocol for the application of ﬂuoride
varnish is currently available from the Scottish Childsmile Manual[footnote 17]
[footnote 18].
The use of ﬂuoride varnish is contraindicated in patients with ulcerative
gingivitis and stomatitis[footnote 19]. There is a very small risk of allergy to
one component (colophony) of the most commonly used ﬂuoride varnish.
Check any medical history with the parent, speciﬁcally check for allergy to
sticking plaster or severe allergy or asthma that has required
hospitalisation[footnote 17], the use of colophony containing varnish
application is contraindicated for these cases. Other brands of varnish may
have different constituents.
Some ﬂuoride varnishes contain alcohol. Because they are being used as a
medicament and are not an intoxicant, it has been agreed (on the authority
of the West Midlands Shari’ah Council) that they are suitable for use by
Muslims, provided that they are used in small amounts, well below that
which would intoxicate, and they are not being used for reasons of vanity.
Clinicians should be aware that many ﬂuoride varnishes on the market are
not licensed for dental caries control, although they may have similar
formulations, and take this into consideration with respect to their
prescribing responsibilities. Practitioners need to be aware of their
responsibilities when prescribing off-licence, and should ensure that they
are in the best interests of the patient and taking account of product
availability[footnote 20].9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 9: Fluoride - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-9-ﬂuoride 9/17Whilst most of the focus on ﬂuoride varnish use has been on dental caries
prevention in children, it is increasingly important to consider its use with
adults at higher risk, particularly frail older people, who have maintained
their natural teeth. Fluoride varnish has the advantage of being
professionally applied and does not have aesthetic challenges.
Fluoride mouthwashes
Fluoride mouthwashes or mouthrinses (0.05% w/v; 230 ppm) can be
considered for patients aged 8 years and above, for daily use, in addition to
twice daily brushing with toothpaste containing at least 1,350 ppm
ﬂuoride[footnote 21]. Rinses require patient compliance and should be used at
a different time to toothbrushing to maximise the topical effect which
enhances the bioavailability of ﬂuoride in the plaque bioﬁlm[footnote 22]. They
are likely to be most useful in higher dental caries risk patients.
There is moderate-certainty evidence that ﬂuoride mouthrinses prevent
dental caries in the permanent dentition, although the evidence is derived
from supervised use at school[footnote 21]. There are no trials of the effect of
mouthrinses on the primary dentition.
Overall, there is insufﬁcient evidence to support daily (230ppm) versus
weekly (circa 900ppm) mouthwash use as superior, in terms of dental caries
prevention[footnote 21]. The available evidence coming from school-based
programmes where children are supervised suggests that regular use of
ﬂuoride mouthrinse results in a large reduction in tooth decay in the
permanent teeth of children and adolescents. The beneﬁt of ﬂuoride
mouthrinse is likely to be present even if children use ﬂuoride toothpaste or
live in water‐ﬂuoridated areas[footnote 21]. For an example of a prescription,
please see Figure 9.4 below.9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 9: Fluoride - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-9-ﬂuoride 10/17Figure 9.4. Prescription for ﬂuoride rinses
Fluorides and the risk of dental ﬂuorosis
A potential side effect of using ﬂuoride as a dental caries-preventive
measure is the occurrence of dental ﬂuorosis, which can occur if a child is
exposed to excess ingested ﬂuoride during the period of tooth
formation[footnote 23].
The risks of ﬂuorosis damaging the appearance of permanent incisors are
relevant only to ingestion of ﬂuoride by those under 3 years old[footnote 17]
[footnote 24], as calciﬁcation of the crowns of permanent incisor teeth is
complete by 30 months.
Risks of aesthetically challenging ﬂuorosis to premolars are only relevant to
those aged under 6 years as calciﬁcation of the crowns of these teeth is
complete by this age. To minimise risk of ﬂuorosis, while still using the
optimum concentration of ﬂuoride in toothpaste[footnote 5], the best approach
is to use very small quantities for children aged 6 years and below, whilst
teeth are still calcifying.9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 9: Fluoride - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-9-ﬂuoride 11/17Children aged under 3 years
Parents of children aged under 3 years are advised to have only a smear of
ﬂuoride toothpaste[footnote 3], when toothbrushing (Chapter 8
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-8-oral-hygiene)) while their incisors
are forming, as shown in Figure 9.5a below.
If a smear of 1,000 ppm toothpaste is used, this amounts to 0.1ml of paste
by volume which contains 0.1mg of ﬂuoride.
When 1,500 ppm paste is used the ‘smear’ (0.1ml) of paste contains
0.15mg of ﬂuoride.
Overall, this results in an absorbable ﬂuoride dose of only 0.007 to 0.01mg
per kg body weight if swallowed, for a child weighing 15kg[footnote 17].
Figure 9.5a. Toothpaste amounts for infants and young children. Smear: up
to 3 years.
Children aged 3 to 6 years
Children aged 3 to 6 years should use only a pea-sized blob of
toothpaste[footnote 3] when teeth are being brushed (Chapter 89/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 9: Fluoride - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-9-ﬂuoride 12/17(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-8-oral-hygiene)) as shown in Figure
9.5b below.
If a pea-sized blob of 1,000 ppm toothpaste is used, this amounts to 0.25ml
of toothpaste containing 0.25mg of ﬂuoride.
When 1,500 ppm paste is used the ‘pea’ (0.25ml) of toothpaste contains
0.375mg of ﬂuoride.
Overall this results in an absorbable ﬂuoride dose of only 0.02 to 0.025mg
per kg body weight if swallowed, for a child weighing 15kg[footnote 17].
Figure 9.5b. Toothpaste amounts for infants and young children. Pea-sized
blob: 3 to 6 years.
Deciding on ﬂuoride delivery options
Fluoride should form part of the standard tools to tackle dental caries and
reduce risk. Standard, age-appropriate advice should be given to everyone,
that is, toothbrushing with ﬂuoride toothpaste (1,350 to 1,500 ppm)[footnote 5].
Additional action for patients who are at higher risk of dental caries should
involve careful consideration based on their history, area of residence,
clinical examination and special investigations such as diet diary. Higher9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 9: Fluoride - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-9-ﬂuoride 13/17ﬂuoride paste (over 1,500 ppm toothpaste) should ideally be a short-term
risk reduction measure whilst the level of sugar in the diet is reduced.
Exceptions will include patients who are at higher long-term risk of dental
caries. This may be because of reduced salivary ﬂow, physical or learning
disability or medical conditions.
Other dental caries-preventive agents
Novel and emerging products
New toothpastes and equivalent products are emerging on the market. They
include toothpaste tablets[footnote 7], albeit supported by limited or no
evidence regarding their effectiveness. Some of these products do not
contain ﬂuoride and are driven by a desire for natural products and also
environmental sustainability[footnote 7]. It is likely that more products will
emerge, and oral healthcare professionals are encouraged to check them
on a regular basis, particularly to check if they contain ﬂuoride. Where
patients have elected to use a non-ﬂuoride toothpaste, it is important to
highlight the loss of dental caries preventive effect and the increased need
to manage their sugar intake to prevent dental caries.
Fluoride in combination with other preventive agents
One systematic review focused on preventive dental regimes and/or one or
more chemical agents applied by a dental professional to reduce the
initiation of root caries lesions or render them inactivate[footnote 11]. It
highlighted that dentifrice containing 5,000 ppm ﬂuoride, and professionally
applied chlorhexidine or silver diamine ﬂuoride varnish, may inactivate
existing decay and/or reduce the initiation of root caries lesions (low-
certainty evidence). However, the results should be interpreted with caution,
due to the low numbers of clinical trials for each agent, the high risk of bias
within studies, and the limiting grade of evidence.
Recent reviews have highlighted the beneﬁts of Silver diamine ﬂuoride
(SDF) in dental caries management[footnote 25][footnote 26], albeit the quality of
evidence is low. Silver diamine ﬂuoride, however, is licensed in the UK for
management of dentine hypersensitivity, not the prevention or arrest of
dental caries. An emerging body of evidence suggests that it is a useful
vehicle for ﬂuoride delivery with the evidence consistently supporting SDF’s9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 9: Fluoride - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-9-ﬂuoride 14/17effectiveness for arresting coronal caries in the primary dentition and root
caries in older adults for all comparators[footnote 26]. SDF can arrest
established carious lesions, especially in primary teeth[footnote 25][footnote 26];
however, it blackens teeth and so has challenging aesthetic properties.
There is also emerging evidence that it may be beneﬁcial in preventing
further root caries in older people[footnote 25][footnote 26].
Further high quality research is therefore required to determine its potential
beyond its current product licence, including investigating its primary
preventive properties and the most beneﬁcial time intervals for its use.
Thus, whilst there is some suggestion that SDF is effective in dental caries
prevention as an agent in young children[footnote 25], and possibly for root
caries in older adults, current evidence essentially focuses on caries arrest.

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-10-healthier-eating 2/21This guidance is issued jointly by the Department of Health and Social Care,
the Welsh Government, the Department of Health Northern Ireland, Public
Health England, NHS England and NHS Improvement, and with the support
of the British Association for the Study of Community Dentistry.
Delivering Better Oral Health has been developed with the support of the 4
UK Chief Dental Ofﬁcers.
Whilst this guidance seeks to ensure a consistent UK-wide approach to
prevention of oral diseases, some differences in operational delivery and
organisational responsibilities may apply in Wales, Northern Ireland and
England. In Scotland the guidance will be used to inform oral health
improvement policy.
Diet in the UK
A healthy diet is important for oral and general health. Surveys consistently
highlight that the population of the United Kingdom is eating too many ‘free
sugars’ (see below), too much saturated fat and salt, and not enough fruit,
vegetables, ﬁbre and oily ﬁsh.
Deﬁning free sugars
The term ‘Free sugars’ includes all sugars (monosaccharides and
disaccharides) added to foods and drinks by the manufacturer, cook or
consumer, as well as sugars naturally present in honey, syrups,
smoothies, and fruit juices.
It does not include sugars found naturally in whole fresh fruit and vegetables
and those naturally present in milk and milk products.
Also included as free sugars are the following:
all the sugars naturally present in fruit and vegetable juices, concentrates,
smoothies, purées, pastes, powders and extruded fruit and vegetable
products
all sugars in drinks except for lactose and galactose naturally present in
milk and other dairy-based drinks including:9/26/24, 3:16 AM Chapter 10: Healthier eating - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-10-healthier-eating 3/21all sugars in unsweetened fruit and vegetable juices, fruit and
vegetable juice concentrates and smoothies
all sugars in alcoholic drinks
all sugars naturally present in dairy-alternative drinks such as soya,
rice, oat and nut-based drinks
lactose and galactose added as an ingredient to foods or drinks, including
lactose in whey powder.
Sources: Scientiﬁc Advisory Committee on Nutrition, 2015[footnote 1]; Swan
and others, 2018[footnote 3]; NHS Eatwell Sugar: the facts, 2019
Some people choose not to have milk and dairy products in their diet for a
variety of reasons, for example, if they are unable to digest lactose (lactose
intolerance), have an allergy to cow’s milk protein or are following a vegan
diet. There are a number of plant-based foods and drinks now available on
the market, which can contain free sugars and individuals are advised to
look at the labelling and choose unsweetened (lower sugar) versions and
those which are fortiﬁed with vitamins and minerals such as calcium.
Free sugars in the diet
Free sugars, if consumed, should only be consumed in small amounts. It is
recommended that the average population intake of free sugars should not
exceed 5% of total dietary energy for age groups from 2 years
upwards[footnote 1]. The recommended upper ‘threshold’ of free sugars
intake, by age, is presented in Figure 10.1 below and can be accessed on
the NHS Change4Life website (https://www.nhs.uk/change4life/food-facts/sugar).9/26/24, 3:16 AM Chapter 10: Healthier eating - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-10-healthier-eating 4/21Figure 10.1. Visualisation of sugar recommendations: recommended
maximum threshold. One cube is 4g of sugar. Source (2)
Age Maximum daily amounts of added sugar
4 to 6 years 5 cubes (19 grams)
7 to 10 years 6 cubes (24 grams)
11 years and over7 cubes (30 grams)
In 2016 to 2019, free sugars intake exceeded the government
recommendation of providing no more than 5% of total energy intake[footnote
4]. Amongst children and young people, girls aged 11 to 18 years and boys
aged 4 to 10 years had the highest mean free sugars intakes as a
percentage of total energy (12.5% and 12.4% of total energy respectively);
whilst children aged 1.5 to 3 years had the lowest mean intake (9.7%)
[footnote 4].
Amongst adults, the reported mean intake of free sugars, as a percentage
of total energy intake, was 9.9% for those of working age (19 to 64 years)
and 9.4% for those aged 65 years and over; thus, exceeding the
recommended threshold[footnote 4]. Amongst adults, men aged 75 years and
over had the highest mean intake at 10.9% of total energy[footnote 4].9/26/24, 3:16 AM Chapter 10: Healthier eating - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-10-healthier-eating 5/21Some encouraging dietary trends have been emerging. National research
suggests that the intake of free sugars is reducing over time in children (less
so in adults), although it remains above recommended thresholds (no more
than 5% of total energy)[footnote 5]. Fewer children and young people report
drinking sugar-sweetened beverages, and those drinking them are
consuming less[footnote 5]. Nonetheless, they remain a signiﬁcant source of
sugar and it should be noted that they get most of their free sugars intake
from the foods presented in Figure 10.2 below and on NHS – Change4Life
(https://www.nhs.uk/change4life/food-facts/sugar), most of which have little
nutritional value.
Figure 10.2. Common sources of free sugar in the diet of children and
young people. Data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey, 2018.
Source (2)
The main sources of free sugars consumed by children are:
soft drinks and fruit drinks
cereal and cereal products
sugar, preserves and confectionery[footnote 6]
In contrast there has been little change in the intake of fruit and vegetables
over the past decade which provide a healthy alternative to free sugars. All
age and sex groups have an average intake of fruit and vegetables below
the minimum recommendation of having ‘At least 5 A Day’[footnote 5]. Thus,
healthier eating advice should routinely be provided to promote good oral
and general health for patients.9/26/24, 3:16 AM Chapter 10: Healthier eating - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-10-healthier-eating 6/21The main impact of the consumption of sugar-containing foods and drinks to
oral health is dental caries in both adults and children; however, there is
some evidence of dietary links with tooth wear and cancers.
Sugar consumption and dental caries
Sugar intake and the frequency of intake of sugars is particularly relevant
for dental caries. The Stephan curve of pH in the oral cavity demonstrates
why frequency is important. It illustrates how demineralisation (area
coloured yellow) of tooth surfaces occurs after every sugar intake and the
subsequent drop in pH that takes place in the mouth as oral bacteria
convert sugar to acid (Figure 10.4a). This process stops as the buffering
action of saliva returns the pH to normal (20 to 40 minutes). Saliva
production varies across a 24-hour day, being stimulated at mealtimes
whereas it is much reduced during sleep.
The impact of frequent sugar intakes is illustrated in Stephan’s curve in
Figure 10.4b. In this case sugar intakes are experienced on many
occasions during the day, so demineralisation occurs more often and the
time between drops in pH is not long enough for effective remineralisation to
take place. When sugar intakes are spaced some hours apart, there is a
good opportunity for remineralisation, which is also more effective in the
presence of ﬂuoride.

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-10-healthier-eating 7/21Figure 10.4. Effect of repeated sugars consumption on plaque bioﬁlm pH.
Reproduced from Chestnutt IG, Dental Public Health at a Glance, Wiley
Blackwell, with permission. (a) The pH of ﬂuid in the plaque bioﬁlm falls
rapidly on eating sugar (within one minute). Slowly recovers over 20 to 40
minutes as pH rises due to buffering and washing effect of saliva, sugar
used up. (b) Repeated intakes of sugar mean that pH remains for prolonged
period below the point which favours demineralisation.
Prospective cohort studies conducted in children and adolescents indicate
that higher consumption (that is, the amount) of sugars, sugar-containing
foods and sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with a greater risk of
dental caries in the deciduous and permanent dentitions[footnote 1]. There is
less available evidence on adults[footnote 7]. A higher frequency of
consumption of free sugar-containing foods and beverages, but not total
sugars, is also associated with greater risk of dental caries in the deciduous
and permanent dentitions[footnote 1]. There is evidence that drinking sugar-
sweetened beverages on a daily basis is related to greater dental caries risk
in adults[footnote 8].
Recommendations to prevent tooth decay are as follows:
minimise the amount and frequency of consumption of sugar-containing
foods and drinks
avoid sugar-containing foods and drinks at bedtime when saliva ﬂow is
reduced, and buffering capacity is reduced
All food and drink containing sugars should be consumed as part of a meal
and not as a between-meal snack. It is important to recognise that honey,
fruit smoothies, fresh fruit juice and dried fruit all contain cariogenic sugars
and should not be consumed as a between-meal snack. Neither should fruit
in sugary syrup. Fresh fruit (or alternatively frozen fruit, or fruit canned in
juice) are recommended snacks between meals.
Fizzy drinks, soft drinks, juice drinks and squashes sweetened with sugar
have no place in a child’s daily diet[footnote 1].
Most free sugars in the diet are contained in processed and manufactured
foods and drinks. Consumers should check labels carefully to ﬁnd out how
much sugar a product contains. NHS Eatwell (https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-
well/top-sources-of-added-sugar/)[footnote 9], Change4Life
(https://www.nhs.uk/change4life)[footnote 10], and the Change4Life food scanner
App are helpful resources.
Similar messages should be reinforced throughout life and this is
particularly important as people enter later life when diet and health
behaviours change, and risks increase under a variety of inﬂuences.9/26/24, 3:16 AM Chapter 10: Healthier eating - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-10-healthier-eating 8/21Diet and cancer
As a population, we would beneﬁt from eating a variety of fruit and non-
starchy vegetables, consuming at least 5 portions per day. Whilst there is
evidence that those whose diets are low in fresh fruit and vegetables have a
moderately increased risk of cancers in general[footnote 11], there is little
evidence that poor diet is a risk factor for oral cancer, compared with using
tobacco and particularly when tobacco and alcohol consumption are
combined.
Diet and tooth wear
In general, patients should be encouraged to eat a healthy balanced diet.
Only where there is evidence of tooth wear should possible dietary risk
factors be identiﬁed and patients advised to reduce the frequency of intake
of acidic foods or drinks; keep acidic food and drinks to mealtimes and
explore alternatives, particularly between meals. It is also important to
advise against methods of drinking that promote tooth wear such as swilling
and swishing.
General good dietary practice guidelines
Below are some of the main healthy eating messages aimed at helping
people make healthier dietary choices.
The 2 most important elements of a healthy diet include:
eating the right amount of food, relative to how active a person is to be a
healthy weight
eating a range of different types of foods in line with the Eatwell Guide
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-eatwell-guide)
The Eatwell Guide (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-eatwell-guide)
[footnote 12] is a key tool that deﬁnes the government’s recommendations on
a healthy diet for children and adults. Of note the guide contains lots of
ﬂexibility for culturally diverse foods. It does not apply to children under 2
years of age because they have different nutritional needs. Furthermore,
between the ages of 2 and 5 years, children should gradually move to
eating the same foods as the rest of the family, in proportions shown in the
Eatwell Guide (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-eatwell-guide). It
makes healthy eating easier to understand by providing a visual9/26/24, 3:16 AM Chapter 10: Healthier eating - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-10-healthier-eating 9/21representation of the proportions in which different types of foods are
needed to have a well-balanced and healthy diet. The proportions shown
are representative of food consumption over the period of a day, or even a
week, not necessarily each mealtime. A balanced diet contains foods from
all 5 major food groups.
The Eatwell Guide (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-eatwell-guide)
encourages us to:
eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day
base meals on potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and other starchy
carbohydrates, choosing wholegrain versions where possible
have some dairy or dairy alternatives (such as soy drinks); choosing
lower fat and lower sugar options
eat some beans, pulses, ﬁsh, eggs, meat and other proteins (including 2
portions of ﬁsh every week, 1 of which should be oily)
choose unsaturated oils and spreads and eat in small amounts
drink 6 to 8 cups or glasses of ﬂuid a day
if consuming foods and drinks high in fat, salt or sugar, have these less
often and in small amounts
Key messages for a healthier diet
Whilst those at higher risk of disease may require speciﬁc advice, everyone
has the potential to beneﬁt from a healthier diet. You may ﬁnd it helpful to
refer patients to the Eatwell Guide booklet
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-eatwell-guide), which is available
online, as this can be emailed to patients[footnote 13].
Eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and
vegetables every day
Eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and non-starchy vegetables every
day. Starchy vegetables such as potatoes only count towards carbohydrate
intake. A portion of fruit or vegetables is 80g. Fresh, frozen, canned, dried
and juiced all count. One portion of dried fruit is only 30g which could be 3
dried apricots or one tablespoon of raisins. It is important to limit fruit juice
and smoothies to a combined total of 150ml per day. Just one portion of fruit
juice or smoothie (150ml) counts as one of (at least) 5-a-day.9/26/24, 3:16 AM Chapter 10: Healthier eating - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-10-healthier-eating 10/21There is evidence to suggest that people who eat lots of fruit and
vegetables are less likely to develop chronic diseases such as coronary
heart disease and some types of cancer.
Potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and other starchy
carbohydrates
Base meals on starchy carbohydrates, including potatoes, bread, rice and
pasta. Choose wholegrain varieties, or keep the skins on potatoes, for more
ﬁbre, vitamins and minerals.
Dairy and alternatives
Eat some dairy or dairy alternatives but choose lower fat options when
possible. For products such as yoghurt, people should be encouraged to
check the label and choose those lower in fat and sugars.
Beans, pulses, ﬁsh, eggs, meat and other proteins
Eat some beans, pulses, ﬁsh, eggs, meat and other proteins. Eat at least 2
portions (2 x 140g) of ﬁsh each week, one of which is oily. Limit processed
meats such as sausages, bacon and cured meats. People who eat more
than 90g per day of red or processed meats should try to reduce the
amount to no more than an average of 70g per day.
Oils and spreads
People should be encouraged to use these products sparingly as they are
high in fat. Cutting down on these types of foods could help to control your
weight as they are high in calories.
Foods high in fat, salt and sugar9/26/24, 3:16 AM Chapter 10: Healthier eating - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-10-healthier-eating 11/21These foods are not required as part of a healthy, balanced diet. If included,
they should only be consumed infrequently and in small amounts. Most
people need to cut down on the amount of high fat, salt and sugar-
containing foods and drinks consumed.
Cut down on saturated fat
Cutting down on saturated fat can lower blood cholesterol and reduce the
risk of heart disease. Most people in the UK eat too much saturated fat. An
average man should have no more than 30g saturated fat a day. The
average woman should have no more than 20g saturated fat a day. Children
should have less saturated fat than adults. A low-fat diet is not suitable for
children under 5 years.
One of the easiest ways to cut down on saturated fat is to compare the
labels on similar products and choose the one lower in saturated fat.
Patients should be encouraged to watch out for foods that are high in
saturated fat, including fatty cuts of meat, sausages, butter, cream, cheese,
chocolate, pastries, cakes and biscuits. It is not necessary to stop eating
these foods altogether; but eating too much of these can result in people
having more than the recommended maximum amount of saturated fat.
Cut down on the amount and frequency of sugar
containing foods and drinks
As stated earlier in this chapter, recommendations in order to reduce dental
caries advocate minimising or reducing the amount and frequency of sugar-
containing foods and drinks. Regularly consuming foods and drinks high in
free sugars increases the risk of dental caries and obesity. Ideally, no more
than 5% of total energy intake should come from free sugars.
All patients and, in the case of children, their parents, are encouraged to
‘sugar swap (https://www.nhs.uk/change4life/food-facts/sugar/sugar-swaps-for-
kids)’. It is particularly helpful to swap drinks containing free sugars for
water, lower fat milk or sugar-free alternatives, including tea and coffee.
Alcohol has a high caloriﬁc content and limiting its intake to within 14 units
per week helps keep health risks low for both men and women[footnote 14].
When advising adults, do also highlight the sugar and calories in alcoholic
as well as non-alcoholic drinks.9/26/24, 3:16 AM Chapter 10: Healthier eating - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-10-healthier-eating 12/21Cut down on salt
Eating too much salt can raise blood pressure, which increases the risk of
developing heart disease or stroke. Adults should eat no more than 6g of
salt a day (6g of salt is about a teaspoonful) and children should have less
salt. Most of the salt eaten is already in everyday foods such as bread,
breakfast cereal, pasta sauce, soups and starchy snacks.
Drink plenty of ﬂuids
Drinking about 6 to 8 glasses of ﬂuids every day is recommended to prevent
dehydration. Water, lower fat milk and sugar-free drinks including tea and
coffee all count. Fruit juices and smoothies count towards ﬂuid consumption
but are a source of free sugars and so consumption should be limited to no
more than a combined total of 150 ml a day and consumption with meals
should be recommended.
Changing to a healthier diet
There is very little reliable evidence available to draw conclusions about the
effects of dietary interventions in the dental setting for reducing sugar
consumption or making other beneﬁcial dietary changes. This reﬂects the
paucity of high quality research in the ﬁeld; however, more promising results
are emerging as outlined below:
1. A systematic review suggests interactive dietary counselling with 11 to 12
year olds may increase their use of xylitol products[footnote 15], as an
alternative to free sugar.
2. A trial involving a tailored 30-minuted structured conversation with
parents and children (5 to 7 year olds) who required extraction of primary
teeth due to dental caries, achieved promising results in caries
management[footnote 16]. This trial, informed by motivational interviewing,
aiming to prevent future dental caries, involved setting preventive goals
and having a review appointment with the child’s general dental
practitioner, who was advised to treat the child as being at high dental
caries risk[footnote 16].
When giving dietary advice to minimise consumption of sugars, it is good
practice to assess the overall pattern of eating to establish the following
information:
the number of intakes of food and drinks per day9/26/24, 3:16 AM Chapter 10: Healthier eating - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-10-healthier-eating 13/21the number of intakes that contain sugars and how many were consumed
between normal mealtimes
whether any intakes containing sugars were taken before bedtime – this
is important as reduced salivary ﬂow overnight reduces dental caries
protective effects
An example of one type of diary
(https://khub.net/documents/135939561/516396401/Example+of+a+diet+diary.pdf/a
d68124b-edf1-7fa3-71f4-02e81149f5f1) is available to download.
Overall, it is important to use contemporary theory and evidence on
behaviour change in general to inform preventive practice as explored
further in Chapter 3 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-
oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-3-behaviour-change). A
diet modiﬁcation approach should be used in conjunction with actions to
increase ﬂuoride availability. However, lowering the amount and frequency
of free sugars consumed will have wider health beneﬁts, preventing weight
gain and obesity which in turn will reduce the risk of heart disease, type 2
diabetes and some cancers.
Diet in the early years
Breastfeeding
Breastfeeding makes an important contribution to infant and lifelong health
and represents the physiological norm for infant feeding for around the ﬁrst
6 months of life. It provides the best start in life and continuing
breastfeeding beyond 6 months
(https://app.box.com/s/1vywgq45v82s0u23rvomip2epttob8be) has beneﬁcial
effects for both mother and child. The additional beneﬁts for infants include
a reduced risk of dental caries[footnote 17][footnote 18][footnote 19], and being less
likely to develop malocclusions compared with ‘never breastfed’
children[footnote 20].
Infants should be exclusively breastfed for around the ﬁrst 6 months of
life[footnote 21] (Chapter 2: Table 1
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-2-summary-guidance-tables-for-
dental-teams#table1)). The available evidence indicates that breastfeeding up
to 12 months of age is associated with a decreased risk of dental caries and
may offer some protection when compared with infant formula[footnote 18].
The evidence on breastfeeding after one year is not straightforward9/26/24, 3:16 AM Chapter 10: Healthier eating - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-10-healthier-eating 14/21because much of the research is observational and does not adjust for
confounders such as dietary factors, oral hygiene practices and use of
ﬂuoride containing products. Further well-designed research is
needed[footnote 17][footnote 22].
Once teeth begin to appear, parents may raise the dilemma of when to
brush a child’s teeth if they fall asleep at the breast. Parents should be
encouraged to brush children’s teeth as close to bedtime as possible and
follow the general guidelines, rather than wake a child to brush their teeth.
Bottle feeding
Families may choose to bottle feed their babies or mothers may be unable
to breastfeed. They should be supported if, after being given advice,
information and support, they opt to bottle feed using formula milk. Only
breast milk, infant formula or cooled boiled water should be given in a bottle.
Sugar, honey or any other sugar-containing products or drinks must not be
added to bottles. From the age of 6 months babies should be encouraged to
drink from a free-ﬂow cup (rather than one with a valve which requires a
child to suck) and feeding from a bottle should be discouraged from the age
of one year[footnote 20].
Infant feeding: Moving on to solids
Children’s food preferences and eating habits are formed early in life and so
it is important to support the development of healthy eating habits in young
children. From around 6 months, infants should be introduced to a wide
range of foods, including iron-containing foods, in an age-appropriate form
and at a time and in a manner to suit both family and individual child[footnote
13]. The transition to include solid foods should occur when infants are
developmentally ready. Solids should be introduced alongside continued
breastfeeding or infant formula; these, and water, should be the only drinks
offered as infants move on to solids[footnote 20].
A wide variety of solid foods with different ﬂavours and textures should
gradually be introduced to diversify the infant diet and to help ensure
nutritional requirements are met. Examples of ﬁrst solid foods include
blended, mashed, or soft-cooked vegetables (for example parsnip, broccoli,
potato, yam, sweet potato, carrot) and fruit (for example apple or pear).
Batons (sticks) of vegetables provide healthy ‘ﬁnger food’ as children begin
to feed themselves. Example menus for early years settings provide lots of
practical menu suggestions[footnote 24], along with the Start4Life website
(https://www.nhs.uk/start4life)[footnote 25]. It is important to encourage parents to9/26/24, 3:16 AM Chapter 10: Healthier eating - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-10-healthier-eating 15/21try a range of healthy foods with children to ﬁnd which ones they enjoy. This
way parents can establish the basis of healthy eating in life.
Commercial baby foods
Commercial baby foods and drinks aimed at children up to 36 months may
provide infants’ ﬁrst non-milk taste experiences and form a substantial
proportion of their diet. Labelling may be confusing for parents particularly
when the terms natural or organic sugars are used – they are still
cariogenic. A recent review found that there are inconsistencies between
national recommendations on infant and young child feeding and the types
of products available, their ingredients, nutrition composition and product
labelling and marketing[footnote 26].
Some commercial baby foods have added sugar or salt or contain
ingredients that are high in sugar or salt. This is more common in
commercial baby ﬁnger-foods, which are often marketed as snacks. Sweet
ﬁnger foods (including biscuits, wafers, puffs, bars, bites, fruit shapes) make
up two-thirds of the baby ﬁnger-food market.
The highest sugar content is found in processed dried fruit products, which
are often marketed as ‘healthy snacks’ due to their fruit content, but the
sugar in these products is often free sugars as they contain ingredients
such as fruit juices, purees and concentrates.
Fruit and vegetables are recommended ﬁrst foods for infants and young
children. Advice is to start feeding infants with single vegetables and fruits,
and vegetables that are less sweet. However, the balance of products on
the market is mainly fruit, particularly mixed fruit; a less sweet product mix
would better prepare babies to accept a wide range of different, less sweet
tastes and protect dental health.
More than one-third of baby meals are marketed at children under 6
months, despite government advice that solid foods should be introduced
(alongside breast milk or infant formula) at around 6 months of age.
Nearly three-quarters of fruit juice-based baby drinks are marketed at
infants under 12 months, which is inconsistent with advice to offer only
breast milk, infant formula or water as drinks between 6 and 12 months of
age.

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-10-healthier-eating 16/21Feeding patterns and practices
Feeding practices are continually changing and raise questions for the oral
healthcare team. When new products are introduced, you may be required
to give advice on products and practices for which there is not speciﬁc
research evidence. As a helpful guide, it is worth reﬂecting on their sugar
content and the principles of sugar frequency and consumption. Recent
examples which encourage grazing include ‘nets’ or ‘paciﬁer-type’ feeding
devices into which carers insert selected foods. Commercially produced
‘pouches’ of food are increasingly common. Around one-third of commercial
baby foods and drinks are packaged in pouches, many of which have
nozzles[footnote 26]. Although some companies provide advice (on the back
of the pack or website) on how to feed these products (from a spoon), this is
not consistent across the market. Whilst there is no speciﬁc research
evidence of the impact for developing teeth it is likely that these foods can
be consumed ‘on the go’ and over longer periods of time; therefore, having
prolonged contact with teeth and, if sugar containing, more likely to increase
the risk of dental caries. It is increasingly important to discuss how products
are consumed as well as their sugar content.
Bedtime routines
The importance of bedtime routines and deﬁning what constitutes a bedtime
routine have recently been the subject of professional deliberations and
research[footnote 27][footnote 28]. The frequency and amount of food and drinks
containing free sugars should be as low as possible in the ﬁrst year of
life[footnote 20]. Only plain milk or water should be provided between meals
for young children and baby juices or sugary drinks discouraged, particularly
at bedtime[footnote 20]. A recent systematic review conﬁrms a consistent
positive association between caries risk and free sugars ingestion around
bedtime across three age-groups (3 to 5 years, 6 to 11 years, 12 to 16
years)[footnote 28]. The certainty of evidence was very low and that is
perhaps not surprising, given the challenges of conducting this type of
research. However, the recommendation to avoid food and drinks
containing free sugars before bedtime in children, (and, of course,
overnight), is based on a sound physiology and good practice for everyone.
Teething
A variety of interventions, gels and solutions are used by parents to manage
teething, generally unsupported by clinical evidence[footnote 29]. However, it
is important to note that some teething products may include sugar[footnote9/26/24, 3:16 AM Chapter 10: Healthier eating - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-10-healthier-eating 17/2129] and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)
has ensured that products should carry this warning[footnote 29]. There is
helpful information for parents on the NHS website on a range of methods
to manage teething including teething rings, painkillers, breadsticks and
fresh fruit or vegetable sticks. Tips for helping your teething baby
(https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/babys-development/teething/tips-for-helping-

Vulnerable groups
Dietary advice for vulnerable groups experiencing medical, physical and
mental health challenges needs to be tailored to their speciﬁc
circumstances (Chapter 4)
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-4-dental-caries) and may involve
close working with colleagues across health and social care. It may require
greater use of protective factors including ﬂuoride (Chapter 9)

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-11-smoking-and-tobacco-use 2/23This guidance is issued jointly by the Department of Health and Social Care,
the Welsh Government, the Department of Health Northern Ireland, Public
Health England, NHS England and NHS Improvement, and with the support
of the British Association for the Study of Community Dentistry.
Delivering Better Oral Health has been developed with the support of the 4
UK Chief Dental Ofﬁcers.
Whilst this guidance seeks to ensure a consistent UK-wide approach to
prevention of oral diseases, some differences in operational delivery and
organisational responsibilities may apply in Wales, Northern Ireland and
England. In Scotland the guidance will be used to inform oral health
improvement policy.
Smoking in the UK
Smoked tobacco in the form of cigarettes, pipes and cigars, together with all
other forms of tobacco, present a major risk to oral health. The overall goal
of the dental team is to help eliminate all forms of tobacco use. It’s worth
highlighting at the outset that much of the tobacco research has been
conducted in relation to cigarette smoking in adults and therefore this may
be reﬂected in the terminology used, where evidence is presented in the
summary tables (Chapter 2: Table 3
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-2-summary-guidance-tables-for-
dental-teams#table3)) and in the text below.
Despite fewer people smoking, it remains the leading cause of preventable
death and disease in the UK[footnote 1]. Between 2016 and 2018, 77,600
deaths were attributable to smoking per year in England with comparable
estimates of 5,000 deaths each year in Wales, 10,000 in Scotland and
2,300 in Northern Ireland[footnote 1]. Furthermore, exposure to second-hand
smoke (passive smoking) can lead to a range of diseases, many of which
are fatal, with children especially vulnerable to the effects of passive
smoking[footnote 2].
Smoking and other forms of tobacco have a signiﬁcant impact on ill health
and health inequalities. Tobacco use, including both smoked and smokeless
tobacco, seriously affects oral health as well as general health. The most
signiﬁcant risk is for oral cancer and pre-cancer. It is also the most common
risk factor for periodontal disease.
In 2019, amongst adults in the UK:9/26/24, 3:11 AM Chapter 11: Smoking and tobacco use - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-11-smoking-and-tobacco-use 3/2314.1% were current smokers (6.9 million) with the population of England
reporting lower levels (13.9%) compared with Northern Ireland (15.6%)
Wales (15.5%) and Scotland (15.4%)
15.9% of men smoked compared with 12.5% of women
younger adults (aged 25 to 34 years) continued to have the highest
proportion of current smokers (19.0%)
prevalence was 2.5 times higher in people in routine and manual
occupations than in people in managerial and professional occupations:
whereas around 1 in 4 people (23.2%) in routine and manual occupations
smoked, compared with just 1 in 10 people (10.2%) in managerial and
professional occupations
since 2014, there have been statistically signiﬁcant declines in the
proportion of current smokers among all socio-economic groups;
however, inequalities have increased
most people take up smoking in their teens or early twenties
Source: Ofﬁce for National Statistics (ONS), 2020
(https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/health
andlifeexpectancies/bulletins/adultsmokinghabitsingreatbritain/2019).
The prevalence of smoking also varies within countries
(https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/statistics-on-
women-s-smoking-status-at-time-of-delivery-england/statistics-on-women-s-
smoking-status-at-time-of-delivery-england-quarter-3-2017-18), and changes over
time so it may be helpful to check local rates for your area as listed in the
resources at the end of this section.
Smoking rates in people with alcohol and other drug dependencies are 2 to
4 times those of the general population[footnote 4].
Smokers are less likely to report having very good health
(https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/health
andlifeexpectancies/bulletins/adultsmokinghabitsingreatbritain/2018)[footnote 3],
when compared with those who have never smoked[footnote 1][footnote 5];
reporting bad or very bad general health was more than 2.5 times as
common in current smokers than those who have never smoked (12.2%
and 4.7%, respectively)[footnote 5].
In Great Britain, more than half (52.7%) of people aged 16 years and above
who currently smoked said they wanted to quit
(https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/health
andlifeexpectancies/bulletins/adultsmokinghabitsingreatbritain/2019) and 62.5% of
those who have ever smoked said they had quit[footnote 1]. Most cigarette
smokers report that they would like to stop and make many attempts to quit.
Currently, around half of all smokers quit using willpower alone[footnote 6].
However, receiving support can greatly increase a person’s chances of
quitting successfully.9/26/24, 3:11 AM Chapter 11: Smoking and tobacco use - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-11-smoking-and-tobacco-use 4/23People are 3 times as likely to quit successfully if they use a combination of
stop smoking aids (including e-cigarettes) together with specialist help and
support (https://www.nhs.uk/smokefree/help-and-advice)[footnote 6][footnote 7].
Supporting smokers in contact with the healthcare system to quit is a
prevention priority in the NHS Long Term Plan
(https://www.longtermplan.nhs.uk/) and every health care professional has a
role to play (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/e-cigarettes-and-heated-
tobacco-products-evidence-review/evidence-review-of-e-cigarettes-and-heated-
tobacco-products-2018-executive-summary)[footnote 8][footnote 9][footnote 10].
Recent research evidence has focused on interventions during hospital
care. A Cochrane Review by Rigotti and others
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22592676/)[footnote 11] found that hospital based
stop smoking interventions that begin during a hospital stay and include
counselling with follow-up support for at least one month after discharge are
effective in increasing quit rates. Such programmes are effective when
administered to all hospitalised smokers, regardless of their reason for
admission. Adding nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to a counselling
programme increases the success rate
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22592676/) of a programme for hospitalised
smokers[footnote 11]. Hospital based programmes that include behavioural
support, pharmacotherapy and follow-up have also been shown to reduce
all-cause re-admissions and mortality
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27225016/) at one and 2-year follow-up[footnote
12].
As many of the adverse effects of tobacco use on the oral tissues are
reversible, stressing their impact on oral health may provide a useful means
of motivating patients to quit. Quitting smoking is the best thing a smoker
can do for their health, and the beneﬁts of stopping begin almost
immediately.
The greatest beneﬁts to oral health relate to preventing periodontal
diseases (Chapter 5 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-
better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-5-periodontal-
diseases)) and oral cancer (Chapter 6
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-6-oral-cancer)). The most
signiﬁcant harms of tobacco use on the oral cavity are oral cancers and pre-
cancers, increased severity and extent of periodontal diseases, tooth loss
and poor wound-healing post-operativel[footnote 13][footnote 14]. Reducing
tobacco use (https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/quit-smoking/nhs-stop-smoking-services-
help-you-quit/) is a key priority for the NHS across the 4 nations of the UK.9/26/24, 3:11 AM Chapter 11: Smoking and tobacco use - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-11-smoking-and-tobacco-use 5/23Chewing tobacco and other tobacco
products
Dental team members should be aware of the various alternative forms of
tobacco and alternative forms of use such as chewing rather than smoking
and that these are associated with oral cancer
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25411778/), other oral pathologies and
negative health effects[footnote 15]. Data on the use of other tobacco products
within the UK is more limited than smoking; however, a recent oncology
paper (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30942182/) highlights that the use of
smokeless tobacco is becoming a global concern[footnote 16]. Smokeless
tobacco is responsible for a large number of deaths worldwide with the
South East Asian region bearing a substantial share of the burden
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27903956/)[footnote 17].
The use of betel quid (paan) with areca nut, with or without the addition of
smokeless tobacco, is especially common within South Asian culture and
mouth cancer is very common in the Indian sub-continent[footnote 18]. Its
social and cultural use is observed across the UK
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18620935/)[footnote 19], with some evidence that
it is impacting on the risk (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27185184/) of oral
cancer[footnote 20][footnote 21].
Shisha smoking (also known as hookah, water pipe, narghile or hubble
bubble) is a traditional method of tobacco use, especially in the Eastern
Mediterranean region, but its use is observed across the world. Many
people wrongly perceive waterpipe smoking as less harmful than smoking
because of the perception that water ﬁlters out the harmful substances in
the smoke. However, it’s associated with many of the same risks as
cigarette smoking. Like smoking, shisha smoking produces signiﬁcant levels
of noxious chemicals (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30609154/) including tar,
carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide and various carcinogens
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7546025/)[footnote 22][footnote 23].
Nasal snuff made from pulverised tobacco leaves is a dry form of tobacco
which is inhaled or ‘snuffed’ into the nasal cavity. Moist snuff typically used
in Scandinavia is known as Snus. Snus can be loose or pre-packaged in
small teabag-like sachets. Other countries have different forms of dried or
moist tobacco (https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/products-ingredients-
components/smokeless-tobacco-products-including-dip-snuff-snus-and-chewing-
tobacco) used for snifﬁng, dipping or chewing[footnote 24][footnote 25]. Chewed
tobacco comes in a number of forms, loose-leaf, dip, plug, twist and chew
bags.
New products are continually emerging such as ‘Heat-not-burn’ tobacco
products (HnB); these are electronic devices that heat process tobacco
instead of combusting it to supposedly deliver an aerosol with fewer9/26/24, 3:11 AM Chapter 11: Smoking and tobacco use - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-11-smoking-and-tobacco-use 6/23toxicants than in cigarette smoke[footnote 26]. Evidence is primarily drawn
from tobacco industry data and lacks research on long-term HnB use effects
on health[footnote 26].
All forms of tobacco that are legal in the UK present an oral cancer risk
(https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005549.pub3/full)
and users of tobacco in any form can be helped to quit through smoking
cessation interventions
(https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005084.pub3/infor
mation)[footnote 27][footnote 28][footnote 29]. It’s important to ask people if they use
smokeless tobacco, using the names that the various products are known
by locally. If necessary, show them a picture of what the products look like
(https://untobaccocontrol.org/kh/smokeless-tobacco/paan-betel-quid-tobacco/#lal),

khaini (tobacco, slaked lime paste, sometimes areca nut)
This may be necessary if the person’s ﬁrst language does not include
English or if the terms are unfamiliar. Although there has been less research
on smokeless tobacco use (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph39), a similar
approach to delivering very brief advice is recommended (Table 2.3) for
patients who are users[footnote 30]. Advising of the health risks, using the
same brief intervention and referring patients who want to quit to specialist
support services is recommended. The outcome then needs to be recorded
in the patient notes, as with all tobacco use.
Effective interventions to support
patients to quit smoking
Healthcare practitioner advice, provided across a variety of healthcare
settings, helps people stop smoking
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23152200/)[footnote 31].
Research suggests (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2792621/) that 95% of
patients expect to be asked about smoking and a short intervention can
make all the difference[footnote 32]. Smokers are more likely to expect to be
asked about tobacco use (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22399549/) and
recognise the need to change than people with other risk behaviours[footnote
33].
Dental teams are in a unique position to provide opportunistic advice to
many ‘healthy’ people who need professional support to stop their tobacco
use and reduce their risk of oral disease. The ﬁrst stage is to establish if the
patient is a smoker, of any form of tobacco. Dental teams across primary
care, community and hospital services routinely investigate tobacco use as
part of standard patient care. Advice can then be given about effective
methods of quitting smoking involving behavioural and pharmacological
approaches as outlined in Figure 11.2: Very brief advice pathway: 30

Very Brief Advice (VBA) from the dental team
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22175545/)[footnote 28][footnote 29][footnote 34], as
outlined in the evidence tables (Chapter 2, Table 3
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-2-summary-guidance-tables-for-
dental-teams)), has been shown to increase a patient’s motivation to quit
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22696348/) and can double a patient’s success
with quitting smoking[footnote 28][footnote 29]. Dental professionals can
successfully deliver tobacco cessation interventions
(https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005084.pub4/full)
to increase the chances of achieving long‐term tobacco‐use abstinence; this
includes single and multi‐session behavioural support, and behavioural
support with the addition of NRT or e‐cigarettes[footnote 29]. Many people will,
however, need VBA on a number of occasions before they are ready to act.
Keep asking and advising because it will make a difference (https://www.e-
lfh.org.uk/programmes/alcohol-and-tobacco-brief-interventions/)[footnote 35].
Ask about smoking
All patients (adolescents and adults) should have their smoking status
(current smoker, ex-smoker, never smoked) established at the beginning of
a course of dental care, recorded, and checked at every opportunity. This is
part of a normal medical history routine in a dental setting and should be
explored during the consultation.
Do you smoke?”
The member of the dental team who elicits this information should ensure
this information is recorded in the patient’s clinical notes.
For those with or at risk of oral disease, most notably oral cancer, pre-
cancer or periodontal disease, due to smoking or tobacco use, it is
important to give VBA.
Advise on the best way of quitting
Inform patients that the best way of quitting is with a combination of
specialist support and medication
(https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008286.pub3/full)
[footnote 36].9/26/24, 3:11 AM Chapter 11: Smoking and tobacco use - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-11-smoking-and-tobacco-use 9/23“
“
“Advice involves making a simple statement such as:
The best way to stop smoking is with a combination of behavioural
support and stop smoking aids, which can signiﬁcantly increase the
chance of stopping.”
Medications that improve the chances
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27734465/) of adults quitting smoking include
combination nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27158893/), varenicline, and bupropion[footnote
37][footnote 38][footnote 39][footnote 40].
E-cigarettes or vapes are not risk free but are far less harmful than
cigarettes and there is growing evidence
(https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng92) that they can help smokers to stop
smoking[footnote 41][footnote 42][footnote 43].
The traditional approach to advice has been to warn a smoker of the
dangers of smoking and advise them to stop. This is deliberately left out of
VBA for 2 reasons: ﬁrst, it can immediately create a defensive reaction and
raise anxiety levels and, second, it takes time and can generate a
conversation about smoking use, which is more appropriate during a
dedicated stop smoking consultation.
Act according to the patient’ s motivation
For those who wish to stop, refer to specialist support services where these
are available[footnote 42]. If not available, it will be important to actively refer
(not signpost) them to their GP or pharmacist:
Would you like me to refer you for specialist stop-smoking advice and
support?”
For those who are not ready to stop, afﬁrm that this opportunity will remain
open to them with:
That is ﬁne, but help is available. Let me know if you change your
mind.”

Harm reduction9/26/24, 3:11 AM Chapter 11: Smoking and tobacco use - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-11-smoking-and-tobacco-use 10/23Ceasing smoking reduces harm, ideally stopping permanently, or
temporarily for example preceding an operation. Other people may reduce
in stages and then stop. People who are not ready or willing to stop
smoking completely may wish to consider using a nicotine-containing
product to help them reduce their smoking en route to harm reduction.
Dental team members should familiarise themselves with the NICE
guidance on Smoking: harm reduction (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph45)
[footnote 44] and the recommendations in NICE Guidance NG92
(https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng92)[footnote 42]. Almost all of the harm from
smoking is caused by other components in tobacco smoke, not by the
nicotine. Smoking is highly addictive, largely because it delivers nicotine
very quickly to the brain and this makes stopping smoking difﬁcult. Nicotine-
containing products are an effective way of reducing the harm from tobacco
for both the person smoking and those around them. It is less harmful to
use alternative nicotine-containing products
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27734465/) than to smoke[footnote 40].
Local services
Expert support from local stop smoking providers, combined with the use of
stop smoking aids gives smokers the best chance of quitting for good.
Depending on the area, services can be based in a range of settings
including integrated lifestyle services, community pharmacies and GP
surgeries further information can be found on the NHS website
(https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/quit-smoking/).
Stop smoking support is free (with the exception of prescription charges
where applicable) and offers a choice of one-to-one or group behavioural
support from a trained stop smoking advisor together with
pharmacotherapy. Smokers who receive this package of support are 3 times
as likely to quit successfully as those who try to quit unaided or with over
the counter NRT.
Dental team members should ﬁnd out what specialist stop smoking
providers (https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/quit-smoking/) (ideally local stop
smoking support) are available locally for their patients. Referral to local
providers for support can be made quicker and easier by adding a template
into your existing data management system.
Where none is available then patients should be directed towards their GP
or pharmacist. Furthermore, it is helpful to be aware if there are speciﬁc
local programmes such as voucher schemes for pregnant women to stop
smoking, given that dental care is free during pregnancy this presents an
ideal opportunity to support smoking cessation. A trial conducted in one
centre showed that women in Glasgow were 2.63 times more likely not to
be smoking at the end of pregnancy when incentives were provided for
supported smoking cessation (https://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h134)
[footnote 45].9/26/24, 3:11 AM Chapter 11: Smoking and tobacco use - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-11-smoking-and-tobacco-use 11/23Overview of quitting methods
1. Local stop smoking services
They offer the best chance of success. Combining stop smoking aids with
expert behavioural support makes someone 3 times as likely to quit as
using willpower alone.
2. Using a stop smoking medicine
A stop smoking medicine prescribed by a GP, pharmacist or other health
professional doubles a person’s chances of quitting.
3. Using over-the-counter nicotine replacement
NRT such as patches, gum or e-cigarettes makes it one and a half times as
likely a person will succeed.
4. Using willpower alone
This is the least effective method.
Figure 11.3. Quitting methods
Pharmacotherapy
Pharmacotherapy is particularly effective when used in conjunction with
behavioural support. Many of these products are available over the counter
in a pharmacy or other retail outlets.
Most of the research involves adults and is related to cigarette smoking.
Whilst the dental team may not be involved in prescribing these products,9/26/24, 3:11 AM Chapter 11: Smoking and tobacco use - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-11-smoking-and-tobacco-use 12/23patients may choose to either obtain them elsewhere on prescription or
purchase them. So it is helpful to be aware of the evidence
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-matters-stopping-smoking-what-
works/health-matters-stopping-smoking-what-works) and to boost patients’
conﬁdence in using them.
NRT, varenicline and bupropion have all been shown to improve the
chances of quitting smoking in adult smokers.
Evidence suggests that:
combination NRT (a patch combined with a fast-acting product) or
varenicline are equally effective as quitting aids
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23728690/)[footnote 38]
all of the licensed forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray,
inhalator and sublingual tablets or lozenges) can help people who make a
quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking.
NRTs increase the rate of quitting
(https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000146.pub5/full
) by 50% to 60%, regardless of setting[footnote 46]
combination NRT is more effective with regard to long term quit rates
(https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD013308/full)
than a single form of NRT in adults who are motivated to quit[footnote 39]
higher dose (21 mg/24-hour) nicotine patches result in higher quit rates
(https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD013308/full)
than lower dose (14 mg/24-hour) nicotine patches in those motivated to
stop smoking[footnote 39]
there is no evidence of a difference
(https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD013308/full)
between fast-acting NRT, such as gum and lozenge, and nicotine patches
in those motivated to stop smoking (based on high quality evidence)
[footnote 39]
varenicline may be more effective
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27158893/) than bupropion with regard to
quit rate and relapse[footnote 37]
varenicline improves abstinence compared with bupropion or NRT,
however it is more likely than placebo to lead to nausea, insomnia,
abnormal dreams, headaches and serious adverse events. The lack of
comparative adverse effects assessment of varenicline with bupropion or
NRT means that ﬁrm conclusions of the overall comparative effects
(https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cca/doi/10.1002/cca.1502/full) of these
interventions cannot be drawn[footnote 47]
NRT may increase the chances of quitting during pregnancy however,
evidence is low certainty
(https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010078.pub3/full
)[footnote 48]. There is no evidence that NRT is harmful in pregnancy and
licensed NRT medication is routinely used to aid cessation9/26/24, 3:11 AM Chapter 11: Smoking and tobacco use - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-11-smoking-and-tobacco-use 13/23Whilst patients may be prescribed varenicline or bupropion, the drug of
choice is most likely to be varenicline
(https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-
adults) unless there are medical contra-indications[footnote 49]. Varenicline
reduces cravings for nicotine
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/smoking-and-tobacco-applying-all-our-
health/smoking-and-tobacco-applying-all-our-health) by blocking the reward
pathway and by reinforcing effects of smoking which take place in the
brain[footnote 50]. Bupropion (Zyban) reduces urges to smoke
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/smoking-and-tobacco-applying-all-our-
health/smoking-and-tobacco-applying-all-our-health) and helps with withdrawal
symptoms[footnote 50].
Considering the speciﬁc safety concerns, contraindications (for example,
bupropion is contraindicated in patients who have seizures), and
comorbidities, the choice of agent is based largely on patient preference
(https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-
adults) after discussion with a clinician[footnote 49]. Current evidence suggests
(https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009329.pub2/full)
that adverse events for these interventions are mild and would not mitigate
their use, although concerns have been raised that varenicline may slightly
increase cardiovascular events (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27158893/) in
people already at increased risk of these illnesses[footnote 37][footnote 38].
There is a growing body of evidence evidence that behavioural interventions
combined with nicotine replacement, provided by dental professionals, may
increase tobacco abstinence rates in cigarette smokers[footnote 29].
Clinical trials have largely been conducted among adults; thus, in children,
there is no evidence to support the use of pharmacological interventions
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29148565/)[footnote 51]). NRT is licensed for use
in children over 12 years of age in the UK.
Reducing smoking
If a patient indicates interest in cutting down their smoking, the healthcare
professional should inform them that health beneﬁts come from stopping
smoking altogether. Any beneﬁts of simply reducing are unclear.
However, the clinician should advise them that if they reduce their smoking
now, they are more likely to stop smoking in the future, particularly if they
use licensed nicotine-containing products
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27734465/) to help reduce the amount they
smoke[footnote 40].
People who reduce the amount they smoke without supplementing their
nicotine intake with a licensed nicotine product tend to compensate by
drawing smoke deeper into their lungs, exhaling later and taking more puffs.9/26/24, 3:11 AM Chapter 11: Smoking and tobacco use - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-11-smoking-and-tobacco-use 14/23Therefore, use of a licensed nicotine-containing product to provide
‘therapeutic’ nicotine is recommended.
Alongside the strong safety proﬁle of NRT, the beneﬁts of advising smokers
unwilling or unable to quit smoking to reduce their smoking using NRT are
likely to outweigh any disadvantages
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27734465/), given that the alternative is likely
to be no action[footnote 40]).
The Stoptober campaign during the month of October provides an
opportunity for smokers to quit, as people who stop smoking for 28 days are
5 times more likely to quit for good (https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/quit-
smoking/)[footnote 52].
Safety of nicotine: evidence and misconceptions
While nicotine is the addictive substance in cigarettes, it is relatively
harmless (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/e-cigarettes-and-heated-
tobacco-products-evidence-review)[footnote 9].
In fact, almost all of the harm from smoking comes from the thousands of
other chemicals in tobacco smoke, many of which are toxic.
Despite this, research ﬁnds that among smokers and ex-smokers in the
UK[footnote 22]:
only 6 in 10 think that NRT is less harmful than smoking cigarettes
only 4 in 10 incorrectly think nicotine in cigarettes causes most of the
smoking-related cancer
Given these misconceptions, advising smokers on the relative safety of
nicotine containing products compared to smoked tobacco is an integral
part of supporting them to quit.
People should be advised to use NRT, or an e-cigarette if they choose as it
will help them to manage their cravings when they stop smoking.
Vaping (e-cigarettes)
E-cigarettes, also known as vapes, are the most popular stop smoking aid
in England (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/e-cigarettes-and-heated-
tobacco-products-evidence-review), with 2.5m users in 2019
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vaping-in-england-evidence-update-
march-2020)[footnote 9][footnote 53].
There are many different types of e-cigarette product and this market is
rapidly changing.9/26/24, 3:11 AM Chapter 11: Smoking and tobacco use - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-11-smoking-and-tobacco-use 15/23E-cigarettes are electronic devices that heat a liquid, usually containing
nicotine, to create an aerosol for inhalation. At present, there is no
medicinally licensed e-cigarette product available on the UK market.
However, the UK has some of the strictest regulation for e-cigarettes in the
world. Under the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016[footnote
54], e-cigarette products are subject to minimum standards of quality and
safety, as well as packaging and labelling requirements to provide
consumers with the information they need to make informed choices.
All e-cigarette products must be notiﬁed by manufacturers to the UK
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with
detailed information including the listing of all ingredients. Leading UK
health and public health organisations including the Royal College of
General Practice, British Medical Association and Cancer Research UK now
agree that although not risk-free, e-cigarettes are far less harmful than
smoking[footnote 50].
Only a very small proportion of young people, who have never smoked,
report that they vape (<1%)[footnote 55]. More than half of current vapers
have managed to stop smoking completely and it is estimated that e-
cigarettes may help over 50,000 smokers a year in England to quit smoking,
who would not have done so by other means[footnote 56].
E-cigarettes are particularly effective when combined with a structured
programme of behavioural support. A major UK clinical trial found that, when
combined with expert face-to-face support, people who used e-cigarettes to
quit were twice as likely to succeed than people who used other nicotine
replacement products such as patches or gum[footnote 57]. People who have
completely switched to vaping should be recorded as non-smokers in dental
records.
NICE guidance NG92[footnote 42] sets out the following recommendations for
health and social care workers in primary and community settings.
For people who smoke and who are using, or are interested in using, a
nicotine-containing e‑cigarette on general sale to quit smoking, explain that:
although these products are not licensed medicines, they are regulated
by the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016[footnote 54]
many people have found them helpful to quit smoking cigarettes
people using e‑cigarettes should stop smoking tobacco completely,
because any smoking is harmful
the evidence suggests that e‑cigarettes are substantially less harmful to
health than smoking but are not risk free
the evidence on e-cigarettes is still developing, including evidence on
their long-term health impact9/26/24, 3:11 AM Chapter 11: Smoking and tobacco use - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-11-smoking-and-tobacco-use 16/23In summary, there is growing evidence that e-cigarettes are helping many
thousands of smokers in England to quit. The available evidence from
research trials suggests that their effectiveness is broadly similar to
prescribed stop smoking medicines and better than NRT products if these
are used without any professional support. E-cigarettes are particularly
effective when combined with expert help from a local stop smoking service.
Implementation and delivery in dental
practice
The National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training
(https://www.ncsct.co.uk/) (NCSCT) has developed a simple form of advice
designed to be used opportunistically in less than a minute in almost any
consultation with a smoker.
All dental team members should be encouraged to undertake the NCSCT
training (https://www.ncsct.co.uk/pub_training.php) as part of regular continuing
professional development, therefore ensuring all dental team members are
competent to deliver VBA and brief interventions in smoking cessation.
The most common intervention dental teams will be involved in is delivering
ASK, ADVISE, ACT in line with VBA to smokers (Figure 11.2
(https://khub.net/documents/135939561/516396401/Figure+11.2+Smoking+pathway.
png/143e2360-8d5a-56e9-2310-f444b42764af?t=1631875111806)). Use of the
evidence-informed pathway will increase the chance of a successful quit
attempt. It just takes 30 seconds and can give patients the motivation to
gain professional help which will increase their chances of quitting. It is
important to be aware of policies, services and routes of access in your
local healthcare system as these vary across the UK. A similar approach
can be followed with all tobacco users.
The best outcomes occur when those who are interested in stopping take-
up a referral for specialist support. Timing is crucially important: the quicker
the contact by a local stop smoking service, the greater the motivation and
interest from the individual. Dental patients who express a desire to stop
should be referred to their local specialist stop smoking support (ideally a
local stop smoking service) to receive the best opportunity to stop smoking.
Dental teams and the local stop smoking services can work collaboratively
in a variety of ways. As a ﬁrst step, it’s important that all members of a
dental team are fully aware of the services offered locally and of how these
operate. Arranging a meeting with a representative of a local provider could
provide a useful opportunity for dental teams to learn about the service offer
and the best ways of referring dental patients.9/26/24, 3:11 AM Chapter 11: Smoking and tobacco use - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-11-smoking-and-tobacco-use 17/23It’s important that no matter who makes the referral, the patient’s progress
in stopping is assessed and is recorded in their clinical notes at each
subsequent dental appointment.
Stopping tobacco use can be a difﬁcult process and is often associated with
a range of unpleasant, short-term withdrawal symptoms, some of which,
such as ulcers, directly affect the oral cavity.
Reassurance and advice from dental team members may help patients deal
more effectively with these problems, thereby increasing their chances of
quitting successfully.
The Cochrane review on tobacco cessation interventions[footnote 58] provided
during substance abuse treatment or recovery is particularly helpful in
managing patients who may have more than one addiction. Current
evidence suggest that providing tobacco cessation interventions targeted to
smokers in treatment and recovery for alcohol and other drug dependencies
increases tobacco abstinence.

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-2-summary-guidance-tables-for-de… 2/23This guidance is issued jointly by the Department of Health and Social Care,
the Welsh Government, the Department of Health Northern Ireland, Public
Health England, NHS England and NHS Improvement, and with the support
of the British Association for the Study of Community Dentistry.
Delivering Better Oral Health has been developed with the support of the 4
UK Chief Dental Ofﬁcers.
Whilst this guidance seeks to ensure a consistent UK wide approach to
prevention of oral diseases, some differences in operational delivery and
organisational responsibilities may apply in Wales, Northern Ireland and
England. In Scotland the guidance will be used to inform oral health
improvement policy.
How to use these tables
These summary tables list the advice and actions that should be provided
for all patients to maintain good oral health. They also outline the additional
support that should be offered to people identiﬁed as being at higher risk of
dental disease. Recent thinking suggests that all patients should be given
the beneﬁt of advice, care and support to improve their general and oral
health, not just those thought to be at risk.
Patients giving concern are those at higher risk of dental disease, or for
whom dental disease, or its management (such as requiring admission to
hospital), would provide a signiﬁcant challenge. They may include:
children or adults presenting with current or past dental disease
children with siblings who have dental caries experience
children who have required dental treatment, including treatment under
general anaesthetic or sedation, or whose siblings have done so
children and adults with physical and learning disabilities
children or adults who are medically compromised, for example those
with diabetes
mentally and physically frail older people including those with cognitive
decline
people undergoing treatments or therapies that place them at additional
risk, for example some cancer treatments or drug therapy that results in
dry mouth
people who are homeless
people who have contextual or environmental factors that may place
them at additional risk for example social disadvantage9/26/24, 3:07 AM Chapter 2: Summary guidance tables for dental teams - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-2-summary-guidance-tables-for-de… 3/23people with speciﬁc conditions that may place them at additional risk of
disease in speciﬁc teeth for example hypoplasia or retained impacted
third molars
people with vulnerabilities that would place them at additional risk from
treatment for example chemotherapy
Further details on assessing risk are outlined in Chapter 1
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-1-introduction). Each patient’s risk
needs to be assessed at every dental recall visit and monitored across the
life course, as disease risk will change over time.
The grading of the quality (or certainty) of evidence and strength of
recommendations in the following summary tables is based on GRADE
(Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and
Evaluations) (https://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/). It reﬂects the extent to
which the relevant disease-based Guideline Development Group (GDG)
[footnote 1] is conﬁdent that desirable effects of an intervention outweigh
undesirable effects across the range of patients for whom the
recommendation is intended.
Strong recommendations – the GDG is highly conﬁdent that desirable
consequences outweigh undesirable or undesirable consequences
outweigh desirable, typically based on high or moderate certainty evidence.
Conditional recommendations – the GDG is less conﬁdent of the
effectiveness of an intervention (low or very low certainty evidence) or the
balance between beneﬁts and harms is unclear.
Good practice – clinical opinion suggests this advice is well established or
supported. No robust underpinning research evidence exists. Good practice
points are primarily based on extrapolation from research on related topics
and/or clinical consensus, expert opinion and precedent, and not on
research appropriate for rating the certainty or quality of the evidence[footnote
2][footnote 3][footnote 4].
It is important to recognise that where a recommendation is conditional
rather than strong, this does not mean that the intervention does not work
but simply that the current evidence supporting it is not of the highest
certainty.
The following tables provide evidence in relation to the prevention of dental
caries, periodontal disease, oral cancer and tooth wear. Where appropriate,
the tables provide advice according to age and/or speciﬁc risk factors.9/26/24, 3:07 AM Chapter 2: Summary guidance tables for dental teams - GOV.UK

Breastfed babies experience less tooth decay and
breastfeeding provides the best nutrition for a baby’s
overall health.
Support mothers to:
• breastfeed exclusively for around the ﬁrst 6 months
of a baby’s life
• continue breastfeeding while introducing solids
from around the age of 6 monthsStrong
For parents or carers feeding babies by bottle:
• only breastmilk, infant formula or cooled boiled
water should be given in a bottle
• babies should be introduced to drinking from a
free-ﬂow cup from the age of 6 months
• feeding from a bottle should be discouraged from
the age of 1 yearGood practice
Gradually introduce a wide variety of solid foods (of
different textures and ﬂavours) from around the age
of 6 months. Sugar should not be added to food or
drinks given to babies and toddlersGood practice
Parents or carers should brush their children’s teeth:
• as soon as they erupt
• twice a day

the Welsh Government, the Department of Health Northern Ireland, Public
Health England, NHS England and NHS Improvement, and with the support
of the British Association for the Study of Community Dentistry.
Delivering Better Oral Health has been developed with the support of the 4
UK Chief Dental Ofﬁcers.
Whilst this guidance seeks to ensure a consistent UK-wide approach to
prevention of oral diseases, some differences in operational delivery and
organisational responsibilities may apply in Wales, Northern Ireland and
England. In Scotland the guidance will be used to inform oral health
improvement policy.
Alcohol misuse
In England, among people aged 15 to 49 years, alcohol is the leading cause
of ill-health, disability, and death[footnote 1][footnote 2]. Alcohol misuse across
the UK is a signiﬁcant public health problem with major health, social and
economic consequences, estimated at between £21 and £52 billion a
year[footnote 3]. Each year there are over 1 million admissions to hospital for
alcohol-related conditions[footnote 4] .
Alcohol consumption is a public health issue across Europe, which has the
highest per capita consumption of alcohol of all regions globally, and the
highest level of alcohol-related harms[footnote 5]. Harmful use of alcohol
contributes not only to the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs),
but also to the burden of communicable diseases, as well as violence and
injuries[footnote 6].
This chapter will highlight the extent of the problem and summarise the links
between alcohol and oral health. It will outline brief advice and the use of a
screening tool which dental team members can use to support their patients
who drink alcohol, to lower their risk in relation to general and oral health.
Alcohol and health
The UK Chief Medical Ofﬁcers (CMOs) advise that to keep the risk from
alcohol low, adults should not regularly drink more than 14 units of alcohol
per week. Alcohol adversely affects health in a range of ways and there is
no deﬁnitively ‘safe’ lower limit – no level of regular alcohol consumption9/26/24, 3:20 AM Chapter 12: Alcohol - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-12-alcohol 3/16improves health. There is a signiﬁcantly increased risk of oral cancers
among drinkers, particularly when combined with smoking or any form of
tobacco use. These behaviours are linked; it is therefore important to
recognise that drinking alcohol during an attempt to stop smoking can
potentially reduce the chances of effectively quitting and this needs to be
considered carefully[footnote 7]. Alcohol has a wide range of health impacts
including cardiovascular disease, cancers (breast, bowel, throat and
mouth), and drinking during pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to the
baby[footnote 3].
For alcohol, frequency of consumption is more important than duration in
years – higher consumption over a few years has a higher risk for oral
cancer than a lower intake over many years[footnote 8], although duration is
still important as a risk factor for other chronic diseases like cardiovascular
disease. There is some variation by site, with evidence by head and neck
cancer sites that drink-years are associated with more pharyngeal/oral
cavity site cancer when compared with laryngeal cancer[footnote 8].
Alcohol consumption
Around 21% of the adult population in England and 24% of adults in
England and Scotland, regularly drink at levels that increase their risk of ill
health (increasing risk and higher risk drinkers)[footnote 9]. The latest health
survey for England, in 2018, suggested that more than twice as many men
than women drank at levels of increasing risk in a usual week (25% and
11% respectively); and, similarly at higher risk levels (5% of men drank over
50 units and 3% of women drank over 35 units)[footnote 10]. Adults living in
the least deprived areas were more likely to drink over 14 units of alcohol in
a usual week than those living in the most deprived areas (27% compared
with 18%)[footnote 10]. Whilst younger adults are less likely to drink than any
other age group, when they do drink, the evidence suggests that
consumption on their heaviest drinking day tends to be higher than that of
older people[footnote 9]. There is emerging evidence that people who have a
dry month such as ‘Dry January’ subsequently reduce their drinking[footnote
11].
What is a unit of alcohol?
One unit equals 10ml or 8g of pure alcohol, which is around the amount of
alcohol the average adult liver can break down in an hour, although this will
vary from person to person. If a wine label says ‘12% ABV’ or ‘alcohol by
volume 12%’, it means 12% of the volume of that drink is pure9/26/24, 3:20 AM Chapter 12: Alcohol - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-12-alcohol 4/16alcohol[footnote 12]. To work out how many units there are in any drink,
multiply the total volume of a drink (in ml) by its ABV (measured as a
percentage) and divide the result by 1,000. Figures 12.1 and 12.2 provide
visual representation of drinks in relation to their units of alcohol.
Figure 12.1. Alcohol unit reference. Source: (13)
One unit of alcohol is: one half pint of ‘regular’ beer, lager or cider, half a
small glass of wine, one single measure of spirits, one small glass of sherry,
one single measure of aperitifs. Drinks that are more than a single unit are:
one pint of ‘regular’ beer, lager or cider (2), one pint of ‘strong’ or ‘premium’
beer, lager or cider (3), one Alcopop or a 275ml bottle of regular lager (1.5),
one 440 ml can of ‘regular’ lager or cider (2), one 440 ml can of ‘super

Guidelines on alcohol9/26/24, 3:20 AM Chapter 12: Alcohol - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-12-alcohol 6/16The UK CMOs’ low risk guidelines for alcohol consumption in 2016 provide
clear recommendations on alcohol[footnote 15][footnote 16][footnote 17].
All adults:
To keep health risks to a low level, it is safest not to drink more than 14 units
per week. For adults who drink as much as 14 units per week, it is best to
spread this evenly over 3 days or more.
Young people:
An alcohol-free childhood is the healthiest and safest option.
Pregnant women:
The safest approach for women who are pregnant, or planning a pregnancy,
is not to drink alcohol at all, to keep risks to your baby to a minimum.
Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to the baby, with the more
you drink the greater the risk. The risk of harm to the baby is likely to be low
if a woman has drunk only small amounts of alcohol before she knew she
was pregnant or during pregnancy.
Cutting down alcohol consumption
A good way to help achieve this is to have several drink-free days each
week.
Drinking risk categories
The term low risk drinking implies that no level of alcohol consumption is
completely safe. Furthermore, the context can determine the level of risk,
for example drinking and driving, in conjunction with medication or where
there is pre-existing chronic illness.
The guidelines state the following.
Low risk drinking
‘Low risk’ is not regularly exceeding 14 units per week, spread evenly over
the week. This level of consumption represents a low risk of long term or
short-term health harm for a healthy adult.
Increasing risk drinking
Increasing risk means drinking in a way that raises the risk of ill health from
drinking alcohol. For both men and women, this means regularly drinking9/26/24, 3:20 AM Chapter 12: Alcohol - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-12-alcohol 7/16more than the low risk guideline of 14 units per week and up to 35 units for
women and 50 units for men.
Higher risk drinking
Higher risk drinking for women is regularly drinking more than 35 units per
week and for men regularly drinking more than 50 units per week. People in
this group are likely to already be experiencing health damage from their
alcohol use, even if it is not yet evident.
Binge drinking
Binge drinking really means drinking enough on a single occasion to get
drunk (The technical deﬁnition of binge drinking is drinking 6+ units
(women) or 8+ units (men) in a single session)[footnote 18]. Drunkenness can
lead to risky behaviour and an increased risk of injury.
Sources: [footnote 15][footnote 19]
Alcohol dependent drinking
Alcohol dependence is a disorder of regulation of alcohol use arising from
repeated or continuous use of alcohol[footnote 20]. The characteristic feature
is a strong internal drive to use alcohol, which is manifested by impaired
ability to control use, increasing priority given to use over other activities
and persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. These
experiences are often accompanied by a subjective sensation or urge or
craving to use alcohol. Physiological features of dependence may also be
present, including tolerance to the effects of alcohol, withdrawal symptoms
following cessation or reduction in use of alcohol, or repeated use of alcohol
or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal
symptoms. The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of
at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if alcohol use is
continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least one month[footnote 20]. Adults
identiﬁed as misusing alcohol encompasses a very wide pathology: people
drinking above low risk but who are not dependent; and people with mild,
moderate and severe dependence.
Interventions which most effectively
support patients to reduce alcohol
consumption9/26/24, 3:20 AM Chapter 12: Alcohol - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-12-alcohol 8/16Supporting patients with brief interventions for alcohol is important in
relation to the prevention of oral cancer and in particular, when combined
with tobacco use (Chapter 2: Table 4
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-2-summary-guidance-tables-for-
dental-teams#table4); Chapter 11
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-11-smoking-and-tobacco-use)). In
addition to the beneﬁts for general health, there is also some evidence that
patients with periodontal disease may have the potential to beneﬁt from
reducing alcohol intake (Chapter 5
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-5-periodontal-diseases)).
Identiﬁcation and Brief Advice ( IBA)
A signiﬁcant proportion of the healthy general population visit a dentist on a
regular basis. There is evidence that identifying patients’ alcohol health risk,
and feeding it back to them along with some advice on cutting down, is
effective in reducing alcohol consumption[footnote 21].
Behavioural counselling for adults
Whereas for non-dependent drinkers IBA is helpful in risk reduction[footnote
19], NICE guidance suggests that adults who are dependent drinkers require
behavioural counselling using motivational interviewing or cognitive
behavioural therapy (CBT) as part of a package of care[footnote 22]. There is
moderate to low quality evidence that behavioural counselling interventions
improve outcomes such as alcohol consumption, heavy drinking episodes,
and drinking above the low risk threshold in adults who have been identiﬁed
by screening in primary care settings as misusing alcohol[footnote 21]. The
evidence for effectiveness of behavioural interventions amongst pregnant
women is inconclusive[footnote 21].
Brief interventions can reduce alcohol consumption for hazardous and
harmful drinkers compared to minimal or no intervention[footnote 23]. Longer
duration interventions probably have little additional beneﬁt[footnote 23].
Children and young adults
There is insufﬁcient evidence currently on the role of behavioural
counselling interventions in reducing alcohol consumption, heavy drinking
episodes, and drinking above recommended amounts in adolescents who
have been identiﬁed by screening in primary care settings as misusing
alcohol[footnote 21].9/26/24, 3:20 AM Chapter 12: Alcohol - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-12-alcohol 9/16Dental teams are in a good position to identify people at risk and provide
brief advice and support to those who are drinking above the low risk levels
(Figure 12.3).
The primary goal of IBA is to reduce alcohol consumption by showing the
patient the following.
1. Their drinking might be putting their health at risk (they may be
completely unaware).
2. What the patient can do about it.

Screening tool (Ask)
The AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identiﬁcation Test for Consumption)
screening tool (https://khub.net/documents/135939561/424776527/AUDIT-

was originally developed by the World Health Organization as a simple
method of screening for excessive drinking and to assist in brief
assessment[footnote 24]. Its shortened form, AUDIT-C, outlined in the
previous version of Delivering Better Oral Health (DBOH) is now widely
used as a screening tool and is shown in Figure 12.4. It is also available as
a patient scratch card. There is evidence that this brief alcohol screening
tool can be successfully used in general dental practice to identify patients
at risk of harm from excessive alcohol consumption[footnote 25][footnote 26].9/26/24, 3:20 AM Chapter 12: Alcohol - GOV.UK

Advise
Advise the patient of the level of alcohol health risk indicated by their score.
Provide feedback and information relevant to their level of risk, and give a
patient information leaﬂet (https://app.box.com/v/CQUIN-structured-advice-tool).
Score 4 or below
Low risk: it’s good practice to give positive feedback and encourage your
patient to keep their drinking at low-risk levels.
Score 5 to 10
Increasing or higher risk: it’s suggested to give brief advice to highlight the
risk of harms caused by alcohol and the beneﬁts of cutting down. Feedback
to the patient that their level of drinking is putting them at risk of developing
a range of health problems (including cancers of the mouth, throat and
breast) and this risk increases the more you drink and how frequently you
drink[footnote 23].
Highlight the recommendations from the CMOs. For example, you can say

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-12-alcohol 11/16to keep health risks from alcohol to a low level, it is safest not to drink
more than 14 units a week on a regular basis
if you regularly drink as much as 14 units per week, it’s best to spread
your drinking evenly over 3 or more days
if you wish to cut down the amount you drink, a good way to help achieve
this is to have several drink-free days a week
Score 11 or 12
Drinking could be becoming a problem, explore the option of referral to a
specialist alcohol addiction service (https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/Alcohol-
addiction/LocationSearch/1805) or to a GP. Do not merely advise these
patients to stop drinking as they may require support to do so safely. They
may need to be referred for a full assessment by a specialised service who
can advise on appropriate support. It can be dangerous for some dependent
drinkers to withdraw without medical supervision[footnote 19].
Other relevant issues
Vulnerable people
Alcohol use is higher among certain groups in society, such as homeless
people, who may also have other conditions or circumstances that
exacerbate the risk from alcohol; they may therefore have additional support
needs[footnote 27].
Combined behaviours: tobacco and alcohol
Tobacco and alcohol are linked behaviours, whereby around one quarter of
smokers drink above low risk guidelines[footnote 7]. Alcohol increases the
level of ‘feel-good’ chemicals produced in the brain by nicotine. Nicotine
changes how the brain responds to alcohol, which means more alcohol is
needed before people get the same feel-good response as a non-smoker
after a couple of drinks.
The available training suggests that there is no harm in talking to patients
about both their smoking and alcohol consumption in one session[footnote 7].
The most important issue is to deliver person-centred advice and support
and therefore the best option may be to offer the chance to explore both9/26/24, 3:20 AM Chapter 12: Alcohol - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-12-alcohol 12/16issues and let the patient decide which to start with. Some health
professionals prefer to talk to their patients about smoking before raising the
issue of alcohol consumption, while others will prefer to let their patient
decide whether to talk about tobacco or alcohol use ﬁrst. Both approaches
are perfectly ﬁne[footnote 7].
It is worth being aware that if a patient is stopping smoking, they may need
to think carefully about their alcohol consumption, as once they have had a
few units of alcohol to drink, their willpower to maintain tobacco cessation
may be reduced[footnote 7].
Apps to assist with alcohol monitoring
There are now free apps that some patients may ﬁnd useful for monitoring
their alcohol consumption such as:
Drink Free Days (https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/apps/)
Dry January (https://alcoholchange.org.uk/alcohol-facts/interactive-tools/the-dry-
january-app-1)
Further evaluation is required on the effectiveness of using technology for
reducing alcohol consumption.

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-6-oral-cancer 2/16This guidance is issued jointly by the Department of Health and Social Care,
the Welsh Government, the Department of Health Northern Ireland, Public
Health England, NHS England and NHS Improvement, and with the support
of the British Association for the Study of Community Dentistry.
Delivering Better Oral Health has been developed with the support of the 4
UK Chief Dental Ofﬁcers.
Whilst this guidance seeks to ensure a consistent UK wide approach to
prevention of oral diseases, some differences in operational delivery and
organisational responsibilities may apply in Wales, Northern Ireland and
England. In Scotland the guidance will be used to inform oral health
improvement policy.
Deﬁnitions
In this guideline, oral cancer is deﬁned as cancerous lesions of 3 distinct
sites: oral cavity (mouth), oropharynx (throat) and lip (outer)[footnote 1],
although these cancers can, and do, cross anatomical boundaries.
The International Classiﬁcation of Diseases and Related Health Problems
10th Revision (https://icd.who.int/browse10/2016/en#/C00-C14) (World Health
Organization (WHO), 2016), deﬁnes these lesions as follows:
mouth (oral cavity) cancer: inner lip (C00.3–C00.9), other and unspeciﬁed
parts of the tongue (C02) (excluding lingual tonsil C2.4), gum (C03), ﬂoor
of the mouth (C04), palate (C05), and other and unspeciﬁed parts of the
mouth (C06)
oropharyngeal cancer: base of the tongue (C01), lingual tonsil (C2.4),
tonsil (C09), oropharynx (C10), and other (C14: pharynx unspeciﬁed,
Waldeyer’s ring, overlapping sites of oral cavity and pharynx)
lip cancer: outer lip (C00.0; C00.1; C00.2)
Epidemiology
In 2016, 3,744 people in the UK were diagnosed with mouth cancer (Table
6.1)[footnote 2]. The risk of oral cancer increases with age. Age-standardised
incidence rates of mouth cancer are higher in Scotland than the rest of the
UK, and are rising in England and Wales[footnote 2]. Mouth cancer is much
more common among males than females with a ratio of approximately 2:1;9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 6: Oral cancer - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-6-oral-cancer 3/16more common among older age groups, with the peak age for diagnosis
being 66 to 70 years[footnote 3][footnote 4].
Data from Scotland reveal wide socioeconomic inequalities in the incidence
of oral cancer with those from lowest socioeconomic groups having a near
3-fold greater incidence risk ratio than those from the highest
socioeconomic groups[footnote 4]; while data from London suggests some
South East Asian ethnic groups have higher incidence rate ratios of mouth
cancer than their white counterparts[footnote 5].
Oropharyngeal cancer
Oropharyngeal cancer incidence rates are rising rapidly in all 4 UK
countries, with 2,977 people in England diagnosed with oropharyngeal
cancer in 2016[footnote 2]. In Wales, oropharyngeal cancer now exceeds oral
cavity cancer rates (Table 6.1)[footnote 2], and has been reported as the
fastest rising incidence of any cancer in Scotland[footnote 6]. The risk of
oropharyngeal cancer is more than 3 times higher among men than women,
and over 3-fold higher among those from more deprived socioeconomic
areas than less deprived areas[footnote 4]. There is some evidence that
people with human papilloma virus (HPV)-related[footnote 7] cancers (such as
oropharyngeal cancer) are diagnosed at a younger age[footnote 8], although
this is not substantially younger than oral cavity cancer, with the peak age
for oropharyngeal cancer diagnosis being 61 to 65 years[footnote 4].
Lip cancer
Lip cancer (outer) is far less common (Table 6.2) than cancers of the oral
cavity (which includes the inner lip) and oropharyngeal cancer. The rates
among men are slightly higher than among women.

Mortality
Survival rates are improving but remain poor overall. Just over half of all
people (56%) diagnosed with mouth cancer between 2009 and 2013 in
England survived for 5 years or more[footnote 10]. The prognosis for
oropharyngeal cancer is a little better, with 66% of people diagnosed with
oropharyngeal cancer during 2009 to 2013 surviving for 5 years or more.
Earlier detection can improve prognosis.
Risk factors
The major risk factors for oral cancers are tobacco use (Chapter 11
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-11-smoking-and-tobacco-use)) and
alcohol consumption (particularly in excess) (Chapter 12
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 6: Oral cancer - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-6-oral-cancer 6/16evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-12-alcohol)), and in combination
with one another. Infection with the human papilloma virus is an important
risk for oropharyngeal cancer[footnote 7], possibly in combination with tobacco
and alcohol[footnote 7]. Excessive exposure to ultra violet (UV) light is a risk
factor for outer lip cancer. There is limited evidence in relation to dietary risk
factors associated with oral cancer (Chapter 10
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-10-healthier-eating)). An overview of
risk factor management is presented in the toolkit in Chapter 2, table 3
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-2-summary-guidance-tables-for-
dental-teams#table3).
Compared with zero tobacco use and alcohol consumption, the risks of
mouth and oropharyngeal cancer increase with any level of tobacco use or
alcohol consumption – there are no safe lower limits[footnote 11].
While most of the available evidence focuses on smoking tobacco, a
growing body of evidence shows that use of smokeless (chewing) tobacco,
often used as a component of betel quid, and betel quid without tobacco (for
example betel quid and areca nut), is associated with increased risk of oral
cavity cancer[footnote 12].
Smoking duration is more important than frequency as a risk for oral cancer
(as with lung cancer); thus, fewer cigarettes per day over a longer number
of years has a higher level of risk for oral cancer than more cigarettes per
day over fewer years. In contrast, frequency of alcohol consumption is more
important than duration; thus, higher consumption (more than three drinks
per day) over a few years has a higher risk for oral cancer than a lower
intake over many years[footnote 13].
Using both tobacco and alcohol increases the risk of oral cancer
exponentially for individuals. It is estimated that people who both drink and
smoke heavily have an over 10-fold increased risk of developing oral cancer
than those people who abstain from both products[footnote 14]. Prevention
approaches for smoking and tobacco use are addressed more fully in
Chapters 11 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-
health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-11-smoking-and-tobacco-
use) and 12 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-
health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-12-alcohol) respectively.
Oral HPV infection is a major risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer in
particular[footnote 15][footnote 16]. The effects on the primary prevention of
oropharyngeal cancer of extending the school-based HPV vaccination
programme to include boys as well as girls will take several decades to
become apparent. HPV may be spread through sexual contact, particularly
oral sex[footnote 17]. In theory the risk of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer
may be reduced by changes in sexual behaviour and adoption of safer
sexual practices. However, as the natural history, prevalence, persistence9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 6: Oral cancer - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-6-oral-cancer 7/16and determinants of oral HPV infection and oropharyngeal cancer are
poorly understood, the strongest preventive approach is, therefore, to
recommend vaccination for young people, both boys and girls.
UV light is a known risk factor for all skin cancers, including cancer of the
outer lip[footnote 18]. It is advisable to avoid the use of sunbeds and tanning
salons[footnote 19]. Sun exposure is necessary for production of vitamin D,
but dental teams may want to familiarise themselves with NICE guideline 34
Sunlight exposure (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/NG34): risks and beneﬁts,
which recommends avoiding getting sunburnt, for example, by seeking
shade when outside for a prolonged period, especially in the middle of the
day (11am to 3pm) and wearing sun-protective clothing (such as hats,
sunglasses and limb-covering close-weave clothing)[footnote 20].
Diets low in fruit and non-starchy vegetables are deleterious for general
health. Fruit and non-starchy vegetables are rich in ﬁbre, vitamins, minerals,
antioxidants and phytochemicals, which help to protect against cancer in
general (Chapter 10 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-
better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-10-healthier-
eating)). There is limited new evidence in relation to dietary risk factors
associated with oral cancers[footnote 21]. Obesity is increasingly being
associated with many cancers[footnote 22], but oral cancers seem to be an
exception with oral cancer risk associated with those with low body mass
index (BMI)[footnote 23]. Overall the evidence supports promoting increased
consumption of non-starchy vegetables and fruit as part of a healthy
diet[footnote 24][footnote 25][footnote 26].
Associations between the risk of oral cancers and poor oral health are
emerging. After adjusting for smoking and alcohol consumption, having few
missing teeth, regular dental attendance, and daily toothbrushing are
associated with a reduced risk of mouth and oropharyngeal cancers, but
wearing a denture was not associated with increased risks[footnote 27][footnote
28]. There seems to be little evidence to show increased risks for oral cancer
with mouthwash use[footnote 29]. Management of the risk factors for oral
cancer, is outlined in Chapter 1
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-1-introduction).
Early detection and management
pathway
Dentists, and other members of the clinical dental team, are the only
dedicated professionals regularly examining a patients’ mouth. Early
identiﬁcation, diagnosis and management of oral cancers can achieve better
outcomes for patients. Dental teams have a pivotal role in the early9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 6: Oral cancer - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-6-oral-cancer 8/16detection of oral cancer and oral potentially malignant disorders or pre-
cancers[footnote 30], including cancers and conditions that can precede the
onset of invasive cancer. These may present as solitary lesions or be
multifocal or widespread conditions within the oral cavity such as
leukoplakia[footnote 31]. A pathway of care for the early detection and
prevention of oral cancer is outlined below.
All patients
1. Ask
Explore risk factors, especially tobacco use.
Use Audit-C questionnaire or scratch card for alcohol consumption.
Record advice given and patient’s response in the clinical notes.
2. Examine
Extraoral: lips, neck, nodes (visual and tactile).
Intraoral: soft tissues (visual and tactile).
High-risk patients
1. Advise
Share the best approaches to changing modiﬁable risk factors in line with
tobacco (Chapter 11 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-
better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-11-smoking-and-
tobacco-use)) and alcohol pathways (Chapter 12
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-12-alcohol)).
2. Act
If a patient is interested in quitting smoking and/or reducing drinking, act to
assist them to address these risk factors by:
providing information leaﬂets (https://app.box.com/v/CQUIN-structured-advice-
tool)
referring tobacco users to local stop smoking support, GP or pharmacist9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 6: Oral cancer - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-6-oral-cancer 9/16considering referral of patients with higher risk alcohol consumption,
particularly in combination with tobacco use to their GP or community
specialist alcohol treatment service (Chapter 12
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-12-alcohol))
encouraging them on their journey and building their conﬁdence
If the patient is not interested in quitting smoking and/or reducing alcohol
consumption:
make a simple statement, for example: ‘That’s ﬁne, but help is available.
Let me know if you change your mind’
record advice given and patient’s response in the clinical notes
keep asking and advising – it can make a difference
Support patients with a diagnosis of oral cancer or potentially premalignant
oral epithelial lesions. Ongoing dental care is particularly important for this
group of patients, particularly those who have had radiotherapy. They are at
a higher risk of a range of conditions including dental caries, oral mucositis
and osteonecrosis (32).
It is good practice for clinical dental teams to take an up-to-date medical,
social and dental history and perform an intraoral and extraoral conventional
visual and tactile examination in all adults at each patient visit[footnote 33].
This may identify possible risk factors for oral cancer, and potentially
malignant disorders and oral cancers. This is in line with the UK’s national
regulatory body’s recommendations[footnote 34].
Extra-oral examinations during routine check-ups provide a good
opportunity for members of the dental team to identify potential lip cancers.
Most symptomless mouth cancers can be detected by means of a visual
examination by clinicians[footnote 35].
Signs and symptoms of oral potentially malignant
disorders
Signs and symptoms of an oral malignancy or potentially malignant
disorders are as follows:
unexplained ulceration or swelling and/or induration in the oral cavity
lasting for more than 3 weeks
a persistent and unexplained lump in the head or neck
a lump on the lip or in the oral cavity
a red patch in the oral cavity consistent with erythroplakia9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 6: Oral cancer - GOV.UK

(‘speckled leukoplakia’)
persistent (not intermittent) hoarseness lasting for more than 3 weeks (if
other symptoms are present to suggest suspicion of lung cancer, refer via
lung cancer guideline)
persistent pain in the throat or pain on swallowing lasting for more than 3
weeks

referral-guidelines-suspected-cancer-january-2019/)[footnote 37].
Less common but important signs and symptoms may include:
unexplained tooth mobility not associated with periodontal disease
delayed healing of an extraction site
ﬁxation of lesion
regional lymph node enlargement
dysphagia
weight loss
cranial neuropathies
Urgent referrals
For adult patients with a clinically evident suspicious mucosal lesion, or
symptom(s) suggestive of oral malignancy, clinicians should provide
immediate referral to a specialist [footnote 33]. Dental team members must
therefore use an ‘urgent suspected cancer pathway referral’ (for an
appointment within 2 weeks) for those with any of the above
symptoms[footnote 38]. General medical practitioners (GPs) have an
established system for making such rapid referrals and dental team
members should also ensure that they are familiar with, and can refer in
accordance with, local head and neck cancer policies and procedures to
ensure that a patient is seen by the correct specialist team[footnote 38]. It is
vitally important that the dental team is aware of this guidance and facilitate
the necessary appointment so that this does not lead to patient delays in
receiving care[footnote 39], should they require it.
The gold standard for diagnosis is a scalpel biopsy and histological
assessment[footnote 40], which is best carried out by the specialist head and
neck cancer team in line with national guidance. There is no evidence
currently to support the use of diagnostic adjuncts such as vital staining or9/26/24, 3:13 AM Chapter 6: Oral cancer - GOV.UK

oral epithelial lesions among adult patients with clinically evident, seemingly
innocuous, or suspicious lesions[footnote 40].
Further guidance on patient support, and the diagnostic process is available
in NICE guidance on recognition and referral[footnote 41].
Prevention post-treatment for oral
cancer
In advance of their cancer treatment and therapies, patients should have
received appropriate care to manage and stabilise their other oral diseases
such as dental caries and periodontal diseases. Afterwards, it is important
that patients who have received surgery, radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy
in the head and neck area make regular visits for dental care. They should
be made aware that they are now at increased risk of a range of oral
conditions including dental caries, periodonitis/peri-implantitis, mucositis
and osteoradionecrosis[footnote 42]. It is particularly important that dental
teams provide appropriate additional preventive care and support for these
patients who may have long-term or lifelong limited opening and reduced
salivary ﬂow[footnote 42].

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-3-behaviour-change 2/14This guidance is issued jointly by the Department of Health and Social Care,
the Welsh Government, the Department of Health Northern Ireland, Public
Health England, NHS England and NHS Improvement, and with the support
of the British Association for the Study of Community Dentistry.
Delivering Better Oral Health has been developed with the support of the 4
UK Chief Dental Ofﬁcers.
Whilst this guidance seeks to ensure a consistent UK-wide approach to
prevention of oral diseases, some differences in operational delivery and
organisational responsibilities may apply in Wales, Northern Ireland and
England. In Scotland the guidance will be used to inform oral health
improvement policy.
Introduction
Given the right circumstances, most oral diseases can be prevented or
managed by ‘healthy behaviours’ such as enjoying a healthy balanced diet
and cleaning teeth and gums effectively. Each day, members of the dental
team provide guidance to patients of all ages about health-related
behaviours as part of contemporary person-centred care[footnote 1]. Helping
patients to improve their oral health involves providing tailored advice,
teaching new skills, answering questions and regularly reinforcing key
messages[footnote 2], whilst understanding that the ability to change is
inﬂuenced by a range of individual, environmental and socioeconomic
factors as outlined in Chapter 1
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-1-introduction).
The ﬁeld of behavioural science has changed signiﬁcantly in recent years.
There have been considerable advances in understanding why individuals
behave in certain ways as well as how behaviour change interventions can
support, and sustain, change[footnote 3][footnote 4][footnote 5]. It is a journey,
rarely an event.
In this chapter, the latest guidance on approaches to supporting individuals
to change their health behaviours is summarised[footnote 1][footnote 2][footnote 3]
[footnote 4][footnote 5][footnote 6][footnote 7] and applied to dental professionals and
oral health behaviours. It suggests how recent advances in behavioural
science can be used by all dental team members, to enhance existing
knowledge and skills. This includes an overview of important considerations
when supporting individual patients through the process or cycle of change.
Practical case studies

illustrate how the guidance may be used in practice.
Behaviours that support oral health
Research highlights the oral health behaviours that dental professionals
may need to support their patients to change through brief interventions

(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-11-smoking-and-tobacco-use))
reducing harmful alcohol consumption through identiﬁcation and brief
advice (Chapter 12 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-
better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-12-alcohol))
Many dental professionals will admit to having felt confused or frustrated
when patients did not make behaviour changes that were recommended.
However, we know that whilst the provision of health information alone may
increase knowledge, this will not achieve sustained changes in behaviour
for most people.
Even when providing more in-depth support, many health professionals will
have experienced how lengthy, and difﬁcult, the process of supporting
patients to change their behaviour can be. They will also have seen ﬁrst-
hand how many attempts are required before a new behaviour is
maintained, overcoming barriers and resistance.
To understand the complexity of behaviour change, we need to consider the
broader inﬂuences on patient’s lives. A patient’s ability to change their
behaviour is inﬂuenced by an array of individual, social and environmental
factors, with socio-economic circumstances being a major inﬂuence
(Chapter 1 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-
health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-1-introduction)). This
explains why multiple unhealthy behaviours, such as smoking, alcohol9/26/24, 3:12 AM Chapter 3: Behaviour change - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-3-behaviour-change 4/14misuse, and lack of tooth brushing, may cluster together in particular groups
of people.
While some individuals with well-developed social networks and supportive
living environments are more likely to succeed, others may ﬁnd changing a
speciﬁc behaviour or group of behaviours particularly challenging. We also
know that at certain times in people’s lives, they may ﬁnd changes in
behaviour easier (or harder) to sustain. Furthermore, fear and cost are
common barriers to dental care and may make it more difﬁcult to support
patients in behaviour change. This means that some patients face multiple
barriers when attempting to change their behaviours. Indeed, these different
barriers to behaviour change may lead to a widening of health inequalities
between groups in society.
Bearing in mind the huge potential for oral and general health gain, some of
the general principles to best achieve oral health-related behaviour change
over time are provided below.
What is important for behaviour change
to occur?
Within the ﬁeld of behavioural science there are many different theories,
models and frameworks that can help health professionals support their
patients to change their behaviour[footnote 1][footnote 2][footnote 3][footnote 4]
[footnote 5][footnote 6][footnote 7]. One of the most helpful recent models is COM-
B[footnote 3][footnote 8]. This model proposes that for behaviour change to
occur, a person must have Capability, Opportunity and Motivation to change
Behaviour as outlined below:
Capability
The person must have the physical or psychological ability to change to the
desired behaviour. This includes a person’s knowledge of what the desired
behaviour is and why it is important, the skills required to make the change
and the self-control needed to start and maintain that desired behaviour
over the long-term.
Consider, for example, what you could do to help a patient trying to reduce
the sugar in their diet. How can you help them to:
understand why it is important for their health and oral health to reduce
their sugar intake?9/26/24, 3:12 AM Chapter 3: Behaviour change - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-3-behaviour-change 5/14choose a healthier alternative they like instead?
keep on choosing healthier alternatives when their initial enthusiasm
wears off?
Opportunity
This refers to the environment in which the person lives, which may include
the social environment required to support the behaviour, for example, their
income; the physical environment; or the facilities available. In the section
above, we have already described how socio-economic circumstances can
be a major barrier to behaviour change.
Consider, for example, helping a patient to give up smoking and how you
can take account of the following:
if they are struggling to cope with stressful events in their lives such as
unemployment, disability, or homelessness
if they live or work with others who smoke around them
how they can access nicotine replacement therapy or local stop smoking
support
Motivation
This relates to the person’s motivation to adopt new behaviour, which would
require the desire, and intention, to change and to stop or adapt their
existing habits.
Consider, for example, what you could do to help a patient routinely brush
their teeth with a ﬂuoride toothpaste twice every day. How can you help
them to:
ﬁnd a time in their daily schedule when tooth brushing would work for
them
think through how to maintain the habit and what to do if they revert to
their previous infrequent brushing
Some patients will need support and help across all three areas of the
COM-B model, while others might experience speciﬁc issues around
capability, opportunity and/or motivation. The COM-B model is not a solution
to all behaviour change challenges, but it can offer dental professionals a
comprehensive framework, when working with patients to better understand
what is going on. It is also very helpful in considering when, and how, to9/26/24, 3:12 AM Chapter 3: Behaviour change - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-3-behaviour-change 6/14facilitate change. This COM-B model has been used to develop a range of
techniques that can be employed to change health behaviour. These are
described more fully in the next section.
What can dental professionals do?
Dental professionals working with patients can help them to build their
motivation to change and support them to act when they are ready. This
involves building rapport and empathy, providing support in an appropriate
format, and considering the right timing (Figure 3.1
(https://khub.net/documents/135939561/516396401/Figure+3.1+How+to+support+p
atients+to+change+their+oral+health+behaviours.pdf/8285ca1b-01cd-952c-04bc-
d82f89749737)).
Changing behaviour should be considered as a cycle. It may start with
patients being unaware of the issue, through a time when they are thinking
about making a change, to when they are actively preparing to change by
planning and setting goals, to when they are ready to act, and then trying to
maintain the change avoiding relapse. As the stages of change need not be
linear, dental team members should start wherever the patient currently is
on the cycle [footnote 9]. This process should not be considered as having
discrete steps and may include the following aspects.
Raising the issue and building motivation
Dental professionals can start conversations with patients by providing
information about the speciﬁc behaviour which needs to be addressed, and
its link to oral and general health (Figure 3.1
(https://khub.net/documents/135939561/516396401/Figure+3.1+How+to+support+p
atients+to+change+their+oral+health+behaviours.pdf/8285ca1b-01cd-952c-04bc-
d82f89749737)). They should help their patients understand the short,
medium, and longer-term consequences of their oral health-related
behaviours. This can also mean discussing what will happen if the person
does (or does not) perform the behaviours. To build motivation further, the
dental team members can help patients feel positive about the beneﬁts of
changing one or more of these behaviours.
Assessing readiness to change9/26/24, 3:12 AM Chapter 3: Behaviour change - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-3-behaviour-change 7/14It is important to assess a patient’s readiness to take action to change
(Figure 3.1
(https://khub.net/documents/135939561/516396401/Figure+3.1+How+to+support+p
atients+to+change+their+oral+health+behaviours.pdf/8285ca1b-01cd-952c-04bc-
d82f89749737)). This can be facilitated by discussing the advantages and
disadvantages of making (or not making) a change, and listening for verbal
clues about their desire, ability, and reasons for change.
Whilst there may be several oral health behaviours you may wish to tackle
with a patient, for general or oral health reasons, it is helpful to recognise
that this cannot be achieved all at once. In this situation, it is important to
discuss with the patient which behaviour they feel most ready to change,
and work with this, even if it is not what you as a health professional would
prioritise.
Patients may express resistance to change if they feel the change is too
difﬁcult or not right for them at that time. In this case, trying to persuade the
patient to change is unlikely to help. Instead, dental professionals should
show empathy, discuss the patient’s views, provide support, and keep the
opportunity for further discussions open for the future.
Supporting patients to take the next step
If a patient is ready to act, one or more of the behaviour change techniques
described below can be used:
working with the patient to show them how to perform the behaviour and
provide tailored instruction
work out a plan together in terms of simple tasks over time, using SMART
goals:
Speciﬁc – clear and precise goals provide focus and clarity of purpose
Measurable – goals that can be easily measured and quantiﬁed
Achievable – goals that are challenging, but within the patient’s reach –
this will increase their self-conﬁdence in making these changes (setting
unachievable goals merely demotivates people)
Relevant – to the patient’s circumstances, motivations and needs
Timely – check that it is the right time to work on the goal. Setting a
clear time frame is also important to help maintain motivation and to
monitor progress
help identify barriers to making changes and how they might be
overcome
plan together how they might cope if there is a relapse in their behaviour
provide encouragement and praise the patient’s efforts at subsequent
appointments9/26/24, 3:12 AM Chapter 3: Behaviour change - GOV.UK

Adapted from NICE Behaviour change overview
(https://pathways.nice.org.uk/pathways/behaviour-change)[footnote 7].
Dental team members already use many of these techniques every day,
while some may be less familiar. Examples of these techniques are
described in the accompanying patient case studies
(https://khub.net/documents/135939561/516396401/DBOH+Behaviour+change+Cas
e+studies.pdf/0a2d5b97-b27c-83dd-f172-5164998e14aa).
Delivering successful behaviour change
When using behaviour change techniques and delivering behaviour change
interventions, consider the source of the intervention (who delivers it), the
mode of delivery (how it is delivered) and the schedule (timing – when it is
delivered)[footnote 5].
S o u r c e
The source of an intervention is the person who will deliver the intervention
with a patient. In dental practices, this may be one dental professional, or
several working together and providing a consistent message. To help
patients achieve successful behaviour change, dental team members need
to build rapport and empathy with their patients to ensure a good
relationship[footnote 4]. This rapport is important so that conversations with
patients about their oral health behaviours can be supportive and conducive
to change.
Effective communication during brief interventions uses a range of skills,
which can be remembered using the acronym ‘OARS’[footnote 10], as shown
in Figure 3.1
(https://khub.net/documents/135939561/516396401/Figure+3.1+How+to+support+p
atients+to+change+their+oral+health+behaviours.pdf/8285ca1b-01cd-952c-04bc-
d82f89749737):
Open questions to explore patients’ feelings and values
Afﬁrmations that you as the dental professional can see the patient’s
point of view, understand the difﬁculties involved and recognise the
patient’s successes
Reﬂective listening and clariﬁcations
Summarising the patient’s thoughts and feelings about making changes
to their oral health behaviours9/26/24, 3:12 AM Chapter 3: Behaviour change - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-3-behaviour-change 9/14Adapted from NHS Scotland[footnote 10].
M o d e
The mode of delivery, how the behaviour change intervention is to be
delivered, should also be considered. Different modes of delivery are
appropriate for different patient groups, disease severities and behaviours.
Dental team members may need to use more than one mode of delivery or
adapt to the needs and preferences of the individual patient.
The most common mode is a face-to-face conversation, but this may be
supplemented with printed resources (for example, leaﬂets, scratch cards or
digital resources, such as links to websites, sending of text messages and
recommendation of speciﬁc apps)[footnote 6]. The NHS app library includes
apps which have been assessed to meet a required standard. New forms of
delivery are emerging in the digital arena with the use of remote
consultations and emails. Patient acceptability of online communication is
growing and may also be helpful for oral health.
S c h e d u l e
Scheduling behaviour change interventions includes consideration of their
frequency, duration, and timing. In terms of frequency, all healthcare
providers, including dental team members, have a role in making every
contact count to improve the health, (including the oral health) of patients.
The ‘Making Every Contact Count’ approach[footnote 11] requires health
professionals to make use of every encounter with patients. For dental
professionals, recall appointments offer the ideal opportunity to highlight
behaviours to change with patients or reinforce earlier interventions.
Equally, for patients who do not attend regularly, visits for urgent care can
also be utilised as they provide an opportunity to establish a positive
relationship[footnote 6] with the option of follow-up care.
The duration of interventions may vary from very brief advice (VBA) or brief
advice (BA) through to more in-depth interventions, such as motivational
interviewing, which requires additional training.
The timing of behaviour change discussions is important because, as
previously mentioned, assessing the patient’s readiness to change will
inﬂuence the type of support the professional provides. Readiness to
change may be more likely at certain key points in the life course, such as
pregnancy or new parenthood, leaving school, starting a new relationship,
or entering retirement. It is also important to recognise that behaviour
change takes time and patients may not complete the whole cycle at their
ﬁrst attempt. There is some evidence to suggest it takes anywhere from 2 to
9 months to develop a new habit depending on the patient and the nature of
the habit.9/26/24, 3:12 AM Chapter 3: Behaviour change - GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-3-behaviour-change 10/14Dental professionals can also provide an environment that is supportive of
health behaviour change, for example:
using the physical space to provide family and breastfeeding-friendly
facilities (https://www.unicef.org.uk/babyfriendly/accreditation/maternity-neonatal-
health-visiting-childrens-centres/) and using displays to support campaigns
such as Smile Month (https://www.dentalhealth.org/national-smile-month),
Mouth Cancer Action month (https://www.dentalhealth.org/mouthcancer),
Stoptober (https://thestoptober.co.uk/) and Dry January
(https://alcoholchange.org.uk/get-involved/campaigns/dry-january)
using digital technology, such as the dental practice website, apps, video
conferencing, links to self-help websites or social media to provide
information, reinforce key messages and provide reminders. Patients can
be recommended to use these resources in preparation for or following
their appointments. However, it is important to be aware of the need to
provide paper resources for patients who are not able or do not want to
rely on digital technology
Examples of behaviour change
interventions
In addition to the general principles and techniques described above,
speciﬁc behaviour change interventions have been developed for some oral
health-related behaviours:
oral hygiene for plaque removal (Chapter 8
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-8-oral-hygiene)) – OH-TIPPS – a
behaviour change strategy for patients to feel more conﬁdent in their
ability to perform effective plaque removal and help them plan how and
when they will look after their teeth and gums
regular use of ﬂuoride (Chapter 9)

evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-9-ﬂuoride) – resources to
support behaviour change conversations with parents of young children

alcohol – Identiﬁcation and Brief Advice (IBA) (Chapter 12
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-
evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention/chapter-12-alcohol))
These speciﬁc techniques and approaches can, and should, be used
alongside the wider and more general techniques described above. Patient
case studies highlighting common pitfalls and suggested ways to overcome
them are provided within the case studies
(https://khub.net/documents/135939561/516396401/DBOH+Behaviour+change+Cas
e+studies.pdf/0a2d5b97-b27c-83dd-f172-5164998e14aa).
Training
While some of the techniques are familiar to dental professionals, additional
training may be required to support behaviour change in general or speciﬁc
oral health behaviour change interventions. A list of helpful
publications[footnote 1][footnote 2][footnote 3][footnote 4][footnote 5][footnote 6][footnote 7]
[footnote 8][footnote 9][footnote 10][footnote 11] and e-learning training programmes
has been provided at the end of this chapter and dental team members
should be supported to undertake the training for the roles delegated to
them and to keep up to date as new programmes become available.
The dental team has an important role in helping to promote healthy
behaviours with all patients. Changing behaviour is not an easy task,
patient’s desires and circumstances need to be central to the endeavour
and different approaches may be needed for different behaviours. It is
important that dental team members understand the principles of behaviour
change and the various inﬂuences on change to enable the provision of the
best possible support to patients. The ﬁeld of behavioural science is rapidly
expanding, with many different sources of guidance published. By
considering this guidance, and how it can be applied, dental teams can
better help patients achieve their oral health goals.

Abstract
This best practice presents recommendations about anticipatory guidance and timing of other clinical modalities which promote oral health  
during infancy, childhood, and adolescence. The guidance, though modifiable to children with special health needs, focuses on healthy,  
normal-developing children and addresses comprehensive oral examination, assessment of caries risk, periodontal risk assessment,  
professional preventive procedures, fluoride supplementation, radiographic examination, anticipatory guidance, preventive counseling,  
sealant placement, treatment of dental disease, trauma, treatment of developing malocclusions, evaluation of third molars, and transition to  
adult care. These preventive recommendations may be applied for the following age groups: six to 12 months, 12 to 24 months, 24 months  
to six years, six to 12 years, and 12 years and older. The guidance emphasizes the importance of very early professional intervention and  
continuity of care based upon the individualized needs of the child.        
The document was developed through a collaborative effort of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry Councils on Clinical Affairs  
and Scientific Affairs to offer updated information and recommendations regarding oral health services and counseling for pediatric dental  
patients.

injuries.14-20 The early dental visit to establish a dental home 
provides a foundation upon which a lifetime of preventive 
education and oral health care can be built.21 The early estab -
lishment of a dental home has the potential to provide more 
effective and less-costly dental care when compared to dental 
care provided in emergency care facilities or hospitals.21-25 
Anticipatory guidance and counseling are essential components 
of the dental visit.4,11,12,21,24-29 The dental home also can influ -
ence general health by instituting additional practices related 
to general health promotion, disease prevention, and screening 
for non-oral health related concerns. For example, oral health 
professionals can calculate and monitor body mass index  
(BMI ) to help identify children at risk for obesity and provide 
appropriate referral to pediatric or nutritional specialists.28
Collaborative efforts and effective communication between 
medical and dental homes are essential to prevent oral disease 
and promote oral and overall health among children. Medical 
professionals can play an important role in children’s oral  
health by providing primary prevention and coordinated care. 
Equally, dentists can improve the overall health of children  
not only by treating dental disease, but also by proactively 
recognizing child abuse, preventing traumatic injuries through 
anticipatory guidance, preventing obesity by longitudinal  
dietary counseling, and monitoring of weight status.30 In addi-
tion, dentists can have a significant role in assessing immuni-
zation status and developmental milestones for potential  
delays, as well as making appropriate referral for further  
neurodevelopmental evaluations and therapeutic services.31  
The unique opportunity that dentists have to help address  
overall health issues strengthens as children get older since  
frequency of well-child medical visits decreases at the same  
time the frequency of dental recall visits increases. Research  
shows that children aged six- to 12-years are, on average, four  
times more likely to visit a dentist than a pediatrician.32,33  
Recommendations
This document addresses periodicity and general principles of  
examination, preventive dental services, anticipatory guidance/  
counseling, and oral treatment for children who have no  
contributory medical conditions and are developing normally.  
Accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date medical, dental, and  
social histories are necessary for correct diagnosis and effective  
treatment planning. Recommendations may be modified to  
meet the unique requirements of patients with special health  
care needs ( SHCN ).34
Clinical oral examination 
The first examination is recommended at the time of the  
eruption of the first tooth and no later than 12 months of 
age.4,21,24,25 The developing dentition and occlusion should be 
monitored throughout eruption at regular clinical examina-
tions.29 Evidence-based prevention and early detection and 
management of caries/oral conditions can improve a child’s  
oral and general health, well-being, and school readiness.7,26,35-38 
The number and cost of dental procedures among high-risk children is less for those seen at an earlier age versus later, 
confirming the fact that the sooner a child is seen by a dentist, 
the less treatment needs they are likely to have in the future.39 
On the other hand, delayed diagnosis of dental disease can 
result in exacerbated problems which lead to more extensive  
and costly care.10,35,40-43 Guidance of eruption and development 
of the primary, mixed, and permanent dentitions contributes  
to a stable, esthetic, and functional occlusion.11,29
 Components of a comprehensive clinical examination 
include:
  •  general health/growth assessment (e.g., height, weight,     
       BMI calculation, vital signs); 
  •  pain assessment;  
  •  extraoral soft tissues examination; 
  •  temporomandibular joint assessment; 
  •  intraoral soft tissues examination; 
  •  oral hygiene and periodontal-risk assessment; 
  •  intraoral hard tissue examination; 
  •  assessment of the developing occlusion;
  •  radiographic assessment, if indicated;
  •  caries-risk assessment; and
  •  assessment of cooperative potential/behavior of child.44
Based upon the visual examination, the dentist may employ  
additional diagnostic aids (e.g., photographs, pulp vitality  
testing, laboratory tests, study casts).10,15,44-46 
The interval of examination should be based on the child’s  
individual needs or risk status/susceptibility to disease; some 
patients may require examination and preventive services at  
more or less frequent intervals, based upon historical, clinical,  
and radiographic findings.8-10,18,20,26,47-49 While the prevalence  
of caries has decreased in primary teeth, the prevalence of  
having no caries in the permanent dentition remains un-  
changed; caries remains a health problems facing infants,  
children, and adolescents in America.37 Caries lesions are  
cumulative and progressive and, in the primary dentition, are 
highly predictive of caries occurring in the permanent denti -
tion.6,50 Reevaluation and reinforcement of preventive activities 
contribute to improved instruction for the caregiver of the  
child or adolescent, continuity of evaluation of the patient’s  
health status, and potentially allaying anxiety and fear for the 
apprehensive child or adolescent.51 Individuals with SHCN  
may require individualized preventive and treatment strategies 
that take into consideration the unique needs and disabilities  
of the patient.34 
Caries-risk assessment (CRA)
Risk assessment is a key element of contemporary preventive  
care. CRA should be performed as soon as the first primary  
tooth erupts and be reassessed periodically by dental and  
medical providers.6,27 The goal is to prevent disease by identi-  
fying patients at high risk for caries and developing individual -
ized preventive measures and caries management, as well as 
determining appropriate periodicity of services.27,52,53 Given 
that the etiology of dental caries is multifactorial and complex, BEST PRACTICES:    EXAMINATION, PREVENTION, GUIDANCE /COUNSELING AND TREATMENT290          THE REFERENCE MANUAL OF PEDIATRIC DENTISTRY
current caries-risk assessment models entail a combination of 
factors including diet, fluoride exposure, host susceptibility, 
and microflora analysis and consideration of how these factors  
interact with social, cultural, and behavioral factors. More  
comprehensive models that include social, political, psycho-  
logical, and environmental determinants of health also are  
available.54-57 CRA forms and caries management protocols  
aim to simplify and clarify the process.6,27,58,59 
Sufficient evidence demonstrates certain groups of children  
at greater risk for development of early childhood caries  
(ECC ) would benefit from infant oral health care.60-64 Infants  
and young children have unique caries-risk factors such as  
ongoing establishment of oral flora and host defense systems,  
susceptibility of newly erupted teeth, and development of  
dietary habits. Because the etiology of ECC is multifactorial  
and significantly influenced by health behaviors,65 preventive  
messages for expectant parents and parents of very young  
children should target factors known to place children at a  
higher risk for developing caries (e.g., early Mutans strepto-  
cocci transmission, poor oral hygiene habits, nighttime feeding,  
high frequency of sugar consumption).26,36,57,66 Motivational  
problems may develop when parents/patients are not interested  
in changing behaviors or feel that the changes require excessive  
effort. Parental attitude, self-efficacy, and intention have a  
strong correlation to oral hygiene practices in preschoolers.67 
Therefore, health care professionals should utilize preventive  
approaches based on psychological and behavioral strategies.  
Moreover, they should communicate their recommendations  
effectively so parents/patients perceive them as behaviors worth  
pursuing. Motivational interviewing and self-determination 
theory are examples of effective motivational approaches for  
caries prevention that share similar psychological philoso-  
phies.68-74 
Studies have reported caries experience in the primary  
dentition as a predictor of future caries.75,76 Early school-aged  
children are at a transitional phase from primary to mixed 
dentition. These children face challenges such as unsupervised 
toothbrushing and increased consumption of cariogenic foods 
and beverages while at school, placing them at a higher risk 
for developing caries.77-79 Therefore, special attention should 
be given to school-aged children regarding their oral hygiene  
and dietary practices. The use of newer technology including 
cellular telephones (e.g., text messaging, apps) may provide  
an additional intervention to improve adherence to oral hygiene  
protocols in children and adolescents.80
Adolescence can be a time of heightened caries activity due  
to an increased number of tooth surfaces in the permanent  
dentition and intake of cariogenic substances, as well as low  
priority for oral hygiene procedures.11,55,56 Risk assessment can 
assure preventive care (e.g., water fluoridation, professional  
and home-use fluoride and antimicrobial agents, frequency  
of dental visits) is tailored to each individual’s needs and direct 
resources to those for whom preventive interventions provide  
the greatest benefit.11,81,82 Because a child’s risk for developing 
dental disease can change over time due to changes in habits (e.g., diet, home care), oral microflora, or physical condition, 
risk assessment must be documented and repeated regularly  
and frequently to maximize effectiveness.13,27
 
Periodontal-risk assessment (PRA)
Periodontal-risk assessment is an important component of the  
routine examination of pediatric patients. The gingival and  
periodontal tissues are subject to change due to normal growth  
and development. PRA identifies risk factors that place 
individuals at increased risk of developing gingival and 
periodontal diseases and pathologies, as well as factors that in-  
fluence the progression of the disease. Risk factors for peri-  
odontal disease may be biological, environmental (social), and  
behavioral.83 Probing assessments should be initiated after the  
eruption of the first permanent molars and incisors as tolerated 
by the child.49 Probing of primary teeth may be indicated 
when clinical and radiographic findings indicate the presence 
of periodontal pathology. Bleeding on probing primary teeth 
during early childhood, even at a low number of sites, is 
indicative of high susceptibility to periodontal diseases due to 
the age-dependent reactivity of the gingival tissues to plaque.84 
PRA can improve clinical decision making and allow the 
implementation of individualized treatment planning and 
proactive targeted interventions.85 Maintenance of gingival  
and periodontal health during childhood and adolescence can 
help assure periodontal health as an adult.49
Prophylaxis and professional topical fluoride treatment 
The interval for frequency of professional preventive services is  
based upon assessed risk for caries and periodontal disease.5,8-10,  
12,13,27,49,58-60 Prophylaxis aids in plaque, stain, and calculus re-  
moval, as well as in educating the patient on oral hygiene 
techniques and facilitating the clinical examination.12 Gingivitis 
is common in children and adolescents and usually responds 
to the implementation of therapeutic measures and routine 
maintenance.49 Hormonal fluctuations, including those occur-
ring during the onset of puberty and pregnancy, can modify  
the gingival inflammatory response to dental plaque.86 There-  
fore, recognizing modifying factors that may result in the 
development of periodontal disease is important.49  
Children who exhibit higher risk of developing caries or 
periodontal disease would benefit from recall appointments 
at greater frequency than every six months (e.g., every three 
months).5,8,10,12,13,27,49,59 This allows increased professional fluoride  
therapy application, professional assessment of oral hygiene,  
and opportunity to foster improvement of oral health by 
demonstrating proper oral hygiene techniques, in addition to 
microbial monitoring, antimicrobial therapy reapplication, and 
reevaluating behavioral changes for effectiveness.5,12,59,87-90 An 
individualized preventive plan increases the probability of good 
oral health by demonstrating proper oral hygiene methods/ 
techniques and removing plaque, stain, and calculus.8,90
Fluoride contributes to the prevention, inhibition, and 
reversal of caries.91-93 Professional topical fluoride treatments 
should be based on caries-risk assessment.21,27,92,94 Plaque and  BEST PRACTICES:    EXAMINATION, PREVENTION, GUIDANCE /COUNSELING AND TREATMENTTHE REFERENCE MANUAL OF PEDIATRIC DENTISTRY           291      
the enamel pellicle are not a barrier to topical fluoride uptake.12 
Consequently, patients who receive rubber cup dental prophy-  
laxis or a toothbrush prophylaxis before fluoride treatment 
exhibit no differences in caries rates.94,95 Precautionary measures 
should be taken to prevent swallowing of any professionally-
applied topical fluoride. Children at high caries risk should 
receive greater frequency of professional topical fluoride appli-
cations (e.g., every three months).91,94,96-98 Ideally, this would 
occur as part of a comprehensive preventive program in a  
dental home.21  
Fluoride supplementation  
The AAPD encourages optimal fluoride exposure for every  
child, recognizing community water fluoridation as the most 
beneficial and cost-effective preventive intervention.91 Fluoride 
supplementation should be considered for children at moder -
ate to high caries risk when fluoride exposure is not optimal.27 
Determination of dietary fluoride sources (e.g., drinking water, 
toothpaste, foods, beverages) before prescribing supplements 
is required and can help reduce intake of excess fluoride.91 In 
addition, supplementation should be in accordance with the 
guidelines recommended by the AAPD91 and the American  
Dental Association99,100.
Radiographic assessment 
Radiographs are a valuable adjunct in the oral health care of 
infants, children, and adolescents to diagnose and monitor oral 
diseases and evaluate dentoalveolar trauma, as well as monitor 
dentofacial development and the progress of therapy.47,48  
Timing of initial radiographic examination should not be based 
on the patient’s age, but upon each child’s individual circum-  
stances.47,48 The need for dental radiographs can be determined 
only after consideration of the patient’s medical and dental 
histories, completion of a thorough clinical examination, and 
assessment of the patient’s vulnerability to environmental 
factors that affect oral health.47 Every effort must be made to 
minimize the patient’s radiation exposure by applying good 
radiological practices (e.g., use of protective aprons, thyroid 
collars, rectangular collimation) and by following the as low  
as reasonably achievable (ALARA) principle.47,101
Anticipatory guidance/counseling 
Anticipatory guidance is the process of providing practical 
and developmentally-appropriate information about children’s  
health to prepare parents for significant physical, emotional, and 
psychological milestones.4,11,21,102,103 Individualized discussion 
and counseling should be an integral part of each visit. Topics 
should include oral hygiene practices, oral/dental development 
and growth, speech/language development, nonnutritive habits, 
diet and nutrition, injury prevention, tobacco/nicotine product 
use, substance misuse, and intraoral/perioral piercing and oral 
jewelry/accessories.4,11,17,21,29,102-111
Anticipatory guidance regarding the characteristics of a  
normal healthy oral cavity should commence during infant  
oral health visits and continue throughout follow-up dental visits. This allows parents to quantify any changes such as, but 
not limited to, growth delays, traumatic injuries, and poor 
oral hygiene or presence of caries lesions. Educating parents  
regarding tooth development and chronology of eruption can  
help them better understand the implications of delayed or  
accelerated tooth emergence. Parents also need to be informed  
about the benefits of topical fluorides for newly erupted teeth  
which may be at greater risk of developing caries, especially  
during the posteruption maturation process.102 Assessment of  
each child’s developmental milestones (e.g., fine/gross motor  
skills, language, social interactions) is crucial for early recog-  
nition of potential delays and appropriate referral to therapeutic  
services.31 Speech and language are integral components of a  
child’s early development.108 Abnormal delays in speech and  
language production can be recognized early with referral made  
to address these concerns. Communication and coordination  
of appliance therapy with a speech and language professional  
can assist in the timely treatment of speech disorders.108  
Oral habits (e.g., nonnutritive sucking: digital and pacifier 
habits; bruxism; tongue thrust swallow and abnormal tongue 
position; self-injurious/self-mutilating behavior) may apply  
forces to teeth and dentoalveolar structures. Although early  
use of pacifiers and digit sucking are considered normal,  
pacifier use beyond 18 months can influence the developing 
orofacial complex.112 Increased overjet and Class II malocclu -
sion are more strongly associated with a finger habit versus a  
pacifier habit.113,114 Children having a nonnutritive sucking  
habit beyond age three have a higher incidence of maloc -
clusions.29,112 Early dental visits provide an opportunity to 
counsel parents to help their children stop sucking habits before  
malocclusion or skeletal dysplasias occur.29,112 For school-aged 
and adolescent patients, counseling regarding any existing  
habits (e.g., fingernail biting, clenching, bruxism), including the 
potential immediate and long-term effects on the craniofacial 
complex and dentition, is appropriate.29 Management of an  
oral habit can include patient/parent counseling, behavior  
modification techniques, appliance therapy, or referral to 
other providers including, but not limited to, orthodontists,  
psychologists, or otolaryngologists.29 
Oral hygiene counseling involves the parent and patient. 
Initially, oral hygiene is the responsibility of the parent. As the 
child develops, home care can be performed jointly by parent  
and child. When a child demonstrates the understanding and 
ability to perform personal hygiene techniques, the health 
care professional should counsel the child. The effectiveness of  
home care should be monitored at every visit and includes a 
discussion on the consistency of daily oral hygiene preventive 
activities, including adequate fluoride exposure.5,8,11,27,91,115
The development of dietary habits and childhood food  
preferences appears to be established early and may affect the  
oral health as well as general health and well-being of a  
child.116 The establishment of a dental home no later than 
12 months of age allows dietary and nutrition counseling to  
occur early. This helps parents to develop proper oral health  
habits early in their child’s life, rather than trying to change  BEST PRACTICES:    EXAMINATION, PREVENTION, GUIDANCE /COUNSELING AND TREATMENT292          THE REFERENCE MANUAL OF PEDIATRIC DENTISTRY
established unhealthy habits later. During infancy, counseling 
should focus on breastfeeding, bottle or no-spill cup usage, 
concerns with nighttime feedings, frequency of in-between  
meal consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (e.g., sweet-  
ened milk, soft drinks, fruit-flavored drinks, sports drinks) 
and snacks, as well as special diets.28,117 Excess consumption of 
carbohydrates, fats, and sodium contribute to poor systemic  
health.118-120 Dietary analysis and the impact of dietary choices  
on oral health, malnutrition, and obesity121,122, as well as  
quality of life, should be addressed through nutritional and 
preventive oral health.28,123 The U.S. Departments of Health  
and Human Services and Agriculture provide dietary guidelines  
for Americans two years of age and older every five years to  
promote a healthy diet and help prevent chronic diseases.123 
T raumatic dental injuries in the primary and permanent  
dentition occur with great frequency with a prevalence of  
one-third of preschool children and one-fourth of school-age 
children.20,124 Facial trauma that results in fractured, displaced, 
or lost teeth can have significant negative functional, esthetic, 
and psychological effects on children.125 Practitioners should  
provide age-appropriate injury prevention counseling for oro-  
facial trauma.17,103 Initial discussions should include advice  
regarding play objects, pacifiers, car seats, and electrical cords. As  
motor coordination develops and the child grows older, the  
parent/patient should be counseled on additional safety and  
preventive measures, including use of protective equipment (e.g., 
athletic mouthguards, helmets with face shields) for sporting  
and high-speed activities (e.g., baseball, bicycling, skiing, four-
wheeling). Dental injuries could have improved outcomes not 
only if the public were aware of first-aid measures and the need  
to seek immediate treatment, but also if the injured child had 
access to emergency care at all times. Caregivers report that,  
even though their children had a dental home, they have  
experienced barriers to care when referred outside of the dental 
home for emergency services.126 Barriers faced by caregivers  
include availability of providers and clinics for delivery of 
emergency care and the distance one must travel for treatment. 
Therefore, primary care providers should inform parents about 
ways to access emergency care for dental injuries and provide 
telephone numbers to access a dentist, including for after-  
hours emergency care.110 Teledentistry may serve as an adjunct 
with time-sensitive injuries or when unexpected circumstances 
result in difficulties accessing care.127   
Smoking and smokeless tobacco use almost always are ini-  
tiated and established in adolescence.111,128,129 In 2020, 6.7  
percent of middle school students and 23.6 percent of high  
school students reported current tobacco product use.130 The  
most common tobacco products used by middle school and  
high school students were reported to be e-cigarettes, cigarettes, 
cigars, smokeless tobacco, hookahs, pipe tobacco, and bidis  
(unfiltered cigarettes from India).130 E-cigarette decreased from 
27.5 to 19.6 percent among high school students and from  
5.3 to 4.7 percent among middle school students from 2019  
to 2020.130 The recent decline reversing previous trends may be 
attributable to multiple factors including increasing the age of sale of tobacco products from 18 to 21 years.130 Children may  
be exposed to opportunities to experiment with other sub-  
stances that negatively impact their health and well-being.  
Practitioners should provide education regarding the serious 
health consequences of tobacco use and exposure to secondhand 
smoke.104,130 The practitioner may need to obtain information  
regarding tobacco use and alcohol/drug misuse confidentially 
from an adolescent patient.11,107 When tobacco or substance  
abuse has been identified, practitioners should provide brief  
interventions for encouragement, support, and positive rein-
forcement for avoiding substance use.104,107 If indicated, dental 
practitioners should provide referral to primary care providers 
or behavioral health/addiction specialists for assessment and/  
or treatment of substance use disorders.107 
Human papilloma virus ( HPV ) is associated with several  
types of cancers, including oral and oropharyngeal cancers.131,132  
Seventy percent of oropharyngeal cancers in the U.S. are caused  
by HPV, and the number of oropharyngeal cancers is increasing  
annually.132 Evidence supports the HPV vaccine as a means to  
lessen the risk of oral HPV infection.131,133 The vaccine provides  
the greatest protection when administered at ages nine through  
12.132 As adolescent patients tend to see the dentist twice  
yearly and more often than their medical care provider, this  
is a window of opportunity for the dental professional to  
counsel patients and parents about HPV’s link to oral cancer  
and the potential benefits of receiving the HPV vaccine.134 
Complications from intraoral/perioral piercings can range  
from pain, infection, and tooth fracture to life-threatening  
conditions of bleeding, edema, and airway obstruction.106 Edu -
cation regarding pathologic conditions and sequelae associated 
with piercings should be initiated for the preteen child and  
parent and reinforced during subsequent periodic visits. The 
AAPD strongly opposes the practice of piercing intraoral and  
perioral tissues and use of jewelry on intraoral and perioral  
tissues due to the potential for pathological conditions and  
sequelae associated with these practices.106 
Treatment of dental disease/injury 
Health care providers who diagnose oral disease or trauma  
should either provide therapy or refer the patient to an  
appropriately-trained individual for treatment.135 Immediate  
intervention is necessary to prevent further dental destruction,  
as well as more widespread health problems. Postponed treat-  
ment can result in exacerbated problems that may lead to the  
need for more extensive care.24,36,37,42 Early intervention could  
result in savings of health care dollars for individuals, com-  
munity health care programs, and third-party payors.23,31,32,36
Treatment of developing malocclusion 
Guidance of eruption and development of the primary, mixed,  
and permanent dentitions is an integral component of com-  
prehensive oral health care for all pediatric dental patients.29 
Dentists have the responsibility to recognize, diagnose, and  
manage or refer abnormalities in the developing dentition as 
dictated by the complexity of the problem and the individual BEST PRACTICES:    EXAMINATION, PREVENTION, GUIDANCE /COUNSELING AND TREATMENTTHE REFERENCE MANUAL OF PEDIATRIC DENTISTRY           293      
clinician’s training, knowledge, and experience.135 Early diag-  
nosis and successful treatment of developing malocclusions  
can have both short-term and long-term benefits, while  
achieving the goals of occlusal harmony and function and  
dentofacial esthestics.136 Early treatment is beneficial for many 
patients but is not indicated for every patient. When there is  
a reasonable indication that an oral habit will result in un-  
favorable sequelae in the developing permanent dentition, any 
treatment must be appropriate for the child’s development, 
comprehension, and ability to cooperate. Use of an appliance  
is indicated only when the child wants to stop the habit and  
would benefit from a reminder.29 At each stage of occlusal  
development, the objectives of intervention/treatment include:  
(1) managing adverse growth, (2) correcting dental and skeletal  
disharmonies, (3) improving esthetics of the smile and the  
accompanying positive effects on self-image, and (4) improving  
the occlusion.29    
Sealants     
A 2016 systematic review concluded sealants are effective in  
preventing and arresting pit-and-fissure occlusal caries lesions  
of primary and permanent molars in children and adolescents  
and can minimize the progression of noncavitated occlusal  
caries lesions.137 They are indicated for primary and permanent  
teeth with pits and fissures.137 At-risk pits and fissures should  
be sealed as soon as possible. Because caries risk may increase  
at any time during a patient’s life due to changes in habits  
(e.g., dietary, home care), oral microflora, or physical condi-  
tion, unsealed teeth subsequently might benefit from sealant  
application.138 The need for sealant placement should be  
reassessed at periodic preventive care appointments. Sealants  
should be monitored and repaired or replaced as needed.138-140
Third molars
Panoramic or periapical radiographic assessment is indicated 
during late adolescence to assess the presence, position, and  
development of third molars.47,48 Impacted third molars are  
potentially pathologic; a 2016 study found the incidence of  
cysts or tumors associated with impacted mandibular third  
molars to be 0.41-0.71 percent in patients younger than 30  
years.141 A decision to remove or retain third molars should  
be made before the middle of the third decade.142,143 Con-  
sideration should be given to removal when there is a high  
probability of disease or pathology or the risks associated  
with early removal are less than the risks of later removal.29, 
143,144 T reatment should be provided before pathologic condi-  
tions adversely affect the patient’s oral or systemic health.142,143  
Postoperative complications for removal of impacted third  
molars are low when performed at an early age.145 A Cochrane  
review in 2012 reported no difference in late lower incisor  
crowding with removal or retention of asymptomatic im-  
pacted third molars.146 When a decision is made to maintain 
disease-free impacted wisdom teeth, clinical and radiographic 
monitoring is appropriate to prevent undesirable outcomes.147Referral for regular and periodic dental care
As adolescent patients approach the age of majority, educating  
the patient and parent on the value of transitioning to a dentist  
who is experienced in adult oral health can help minimize 
disruption of high-quality, developmentally-appropriate health 
care. At the time agreed upon by the patient, parent, and  
pediatric dentist, the patient should be referred to a specific 
practitioner in an environment sensitive to the adolescent’s  
individual needs.11,148 Until the new dental home is established,  
the patient should maintain a relationship with the current  
care provider and have access to emergency services. For the  
patient with SHCN, in cases where it is not possible or desired 
to transition to another practitioner, the dental home can  
remain with the pediatric dentist, and appropriate referrals 
for specialized dental care should be recommended when  
needed.148 Proper communication and records transfer allow  
for consistent and continuous care for the patient.44

and Anticipatory Guidance/Counseling
Since each child is unique, these recommendations are designed for the care of children who have no contributing medical conditions and are developing normally. These recommendations will need to be  
modified for children with special health care needs or if disease or trauma manifests variations from normal. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry emphasizes the importance of very early professional  
intervention and the continuity of care based on the individualized needs of the child. Refer to the text of this best practice for supporting information and references.

1 First examination at the eruption of the first tooth and no later than 12 months. Repeat every six months or as indicated  
by child’s risk status/susceptibility todisease. Includes assessment of pathology and injuries. 
2 By clinical examination.
3 Must be repeated regularly and frequently to maximize effectiveness.
4 Timing, types, and frequency determined by child’s history, clinical findings, and susceptibility to oral disease.
5 Consider when systemic fluoride exposure is suboptimal. Up to at least 16 years. 
6 Appropriate discussion and counseling should be an integral part of each visit for care.
7 Initially, responsibility of parent; as child matures, jointly with parent; then, when indicated, only child.
8 At every appointment; initially discuss appropriate feeding practices, then the role of refined carbohydrates and frequency 
of snacking in caries development and childhood obesity. Monitor body mass index beginning at age two.
9 At first, discuss the need for nonnutritive sucking: digits vs. pacifiers; then the need to wean from the habit before maloc -
clusion or deleterious effect on the dentofacial complex occurs. For school-aged children and adolescent patients, counsel 
regarding any existing habits such as fingernail biting, clenching, or bruxism.10  Initially pacifiers, car seats, play objects, electric cords; secondhand smoke; when learning to walk; with sports 
and routine playing, including the importance of mouthguards; then motor vehicles and high-speed activities. 
11 Observation for age-appropriate speech articulation and fluency as well as achieving receptive and expressive  
language milestones.
12  Identify: transverse, vertical, and sagittal growth patterns; asymmetry; occlusal disharmonies; functional status  
including temporomandibular joint dysfunction; esthetic influences on self-image and emotional development.
13   For caries-susceptible primary molars, permanent molars, premolars, and anterior teeth with deep pits and  
fissures; placed as soon as possible after eruption.
14 Periodontal probing should be added to the risk-assessment process after the eruption of the first permanent 
molars. 1
